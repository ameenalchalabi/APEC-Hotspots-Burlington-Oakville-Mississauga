EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
VTX Consulting Services Inc. (VTX) was retained by Choice Properties Limited Partnership (Client) 
to complete a Phase One Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the property located at 13311 
Loyalist Parkway in Picton, Ontario, hereinafter referred to as the “Phase One Property”. The 
Phase One ESA was undertaken for the Client to support an upcoming Zoning By-law Amendment 
(ZBA) redevelopment application.  
The Site is located on the southeast side of Loyalist Parkway, approximately 300 metres (m) west 
of Cold Storage Road. The Phase One Property is currently occupied by a grocery store (No Frills) 
and a retail fuel outlet (RFO; Mobil). The remaining areas of the Phase One Property consist of 
asphalt-paved parking areas and driveway, concrete walkways, manicured lawns, and 
undeveloped land (low-lying vegetation and trees). Adjacent and neighbouring lands surrounding 
the Site include a commercial plaza (northwest), residential dwellings (northwest/north), a 
fitness centre (east), a transformer substation (south), agricultural or other land use (south), and 
a Canadian Tire store (west). 
The scope of the Phase One ESA conforms to the requirements outlined in Ontario Regulation 
153/04, as amended (O. Reg. 153/04 or the regulation), unless whereas otherwise specified. The 
Phase One ESA objectives were to develop a preliminary determination of the likelihood that one 
or more contaminants have affected any land or water on, in or under the Phase One Property, 
to determine the need for a Phase Two ESA, and to provide a basis for carrying out any Phase 
Two ESA required. The Phase One ESA did not include sampling or testing and was based solely 
on visual observations and review and evaluation of available information.  
Based on information obtained as part of the Phase One ESA, VTX presents the following findings: 
• The first developed use of the Phase One Property was determined be a review of 
available records at the issue date of this report. Aerial photographs indicate that the 
Phase One Property was residential and/or agricultural in 1929. Therefore, the first 
developed use of the Phase One Property was prior to or in 1929.  
• The current site buildings were constructed in the early 2000s.  
• Bedrock geologic mapping of Southern Ontario indicates the Phase One Property is 
underlain by limestone, dolostone, shale, arkose, and/or sandstone. The depth to bedrock 
was not indicated on the reviewed map; however, previous geotechnical investigations 
completed at the Phase One Property encountered inferred bedrock at depths of 
approximately 0.33 metres below ground surface (mbgs) to approximately 2.9 mbgs. 
Quaternary geologic mapping of Southern Ontario indicates surficial soil at the Phase One 
Property consists of sand, gravelly sand, and gravel. Previous geotechnical investigations 
at the Phase One Property encountered clayey silt, silty sand, and sandy silt within the 
overburden. 
• The area of the Phase One Property generally slopes downward to the south/southeast. 
Based on regional topography and nearby waterbodies, shallow groundwater in the area 
is inferred to flow in a southeasterly direction towards an unnamed tributary that 
eventually discharges to West Lake, located approximately 8 km to the west. 
• The following on-site potentially contaminating activities (PCAs) were identified:

o 28-1: Gasoline and Associated Products Storage in Fixed Tanks, eastern portion of 
Phase One Property. 
o A-1: Not Specified – Known Gasoline Spill, eastern portion of Phase One Property.  
o B-1: Not Specified – Application of De-icing Substances, paved areas of Phase One 
Property.  
• The following off-site PCAs were identified within the Phase One Study Area: 
o 27-1: Garages and Maintenance and Repair of Railcars, Marine Vehicles and 
Aviation Vehicles, inferred as hydraulically upgradient and approximately 70 m to 
the west of the Phase One Property. 
o 28-2: Gasoline and Associated Products Storage in Fixed Tanks, inferred as 
hydraulically upgradient and approximately 50 m to the north of the Phase One 
Property. 
o 28-3: Gasoline and Associated Products Storage in Fixed Tanks, inferred as 
hydraulically upgradient and approximately 25 m to the west of the Phase One 
Property. 
o 46-1: Rail Yards, Tracks and Spurs, inferred as hydraulically downgradient and 
approximately 5 m to the south of the Phase One Property.  
o 55-1: Transformer Manufacturing, Processing and Use, inferred as hydraulically 
downgradient and south adjacent to the Phase One Property.  
o A-2: Not Specified – Known contamination, inferred as hydraulically upgradient 
and approximately 50 m to the north of the Phase One Property.  
o B-2: Not Specified – Application of De-icing Substances, paved footprint of Loyalist 
Parkway, inferred as hydraulically upgradient and north adjacent to the Phase One 
Property.  
o C-1: Not Specified – Maintenance Yard, inferred as hydraulically upgradient and 
approximately 50 m to the north of the Phase One Property.  
o D-1: Not Specified – Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Storage, inferred as 
hydraulically upgradient and approximately 50 m to the north of the Phase One 
Property.  
Based on information obtained, reviewed, and evaluated during this Phase One ESA, three (3) 
on-site and eight (8) off-site PCAs have been identified as giving rise or contributing to six (6) 
areas of potential environmental concern on the Phase One Property. The associated 
contaminants of potential concern include volatile organic compounds, petroleum hydrocarbons, 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PCBs, metals, hydride-forming metals, hexavalent chromium, 
mercury, electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, chloride, sodium and low or high pH. 
Through the review of available records including but not limited to aerial photographs and an 
ERIS report, the conduct of interviews, completion of a site reconnaissance, and review and 
evaluation of information, the Qualified Person has determined that a Phase Two ESA will be 
required to support an RSC submission.  
The Qualified Person has determined an RSC cannot be filed based on the Phase One ESA alone.

INTRODUCTION 
VTX Consulting Services Inc. (VTX) was retained by Choice Properties Limited Partnership (Client) 
to complete a Phase One Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the property located at 13311 
Loyalist Parkway in Picton, Ontario, hereinafter referred to as the “Phase One Property”. The 
Phase One ESA was undertaken for the Client to support an upcoming Zoning By-law Amendment 
(ZBA) redevelopment application.  
VTX understands that the Client is planning to build two (2) commercial buildings at the Phase 
One Property. Although the proposed redevelopment does not result in a change of land use, 
VTX understands that the County of Prince Edward requires a Phase One ESA report to be 
completed in accordance with Ontario Regulation 153/04 (O. Reg. 153/04). At this time, it is 
unknown if the filing of a Record of Site Condition (RSC) with the Ontario Ministry of the 
Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) will be required for the Phase One Property. 
2.1 
Phase One Property Information 
The Site is located on the southeast side of Loyalist Parkway, approximately 300 metres (m) west 
of Cold Storage Road. The Site is currently developed with a No Frills grocery store and a retail 
fuel outlet (RFO) branded as Mobil. Buildings present at the Phase One Property include the No 
Frills grocery store and a Mobil convenience store, collectively referred to as the Site Buildings. 
Adjacent and neighbouring lands surrounding the Site include a commercial plaza (northwest), 
residential dwellings (northwest/north), a fitness centre (east), a transformer substation (south), 
agricultural or other land use, and a Canadian Tire store (west).

SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION 
The scope of the Phase One ESA conforms to the requirements outlined in Ontario Regulation 
153/04, as amended (O. Reg. 153/04 or the regulation), unless whereas otherwise specified. The 
Phase One ESA objectives were to develop a preliminary determination of the likelihood that one 
or more contaminants have affected any land or water on, in or under the Phase One Property, 
to determine the need for a Phase Two ESA, and to provide a basis for carrying out any Phase 
Two ESA required. The Phase One ESA did not include sampling or testing and was based solely 
on visual observations and review and evaluation of available information.  
The principal components of this Phase One ESA report consisted of the following: 
• records review 
• interviews 
• site reconnaissance 
• review and evaluation of information, including preparation of a Phase One Conceptual 
Site Model (CSM) and this Phase One ESA report 
More specifically, the following was completed under the preparation and/or supervision of the 
Qualified Person per the meaning of Section 5 of O. Reg. 153/04: 
• A review was conducted of selected aerial photographs provided by ERIS. 
• A historical city directory review was purchased from ERIS. 
• A report consisting of a search of federal, provincial, and private source databases within 
a 250 m radius of the boundary of the Phase One Property was purchased from ERIS. 
• A request for fire insurance plans (FIPs) and property underwriter reports/plans for the 
Phase One Property and/or nearby lands was submitted to Opta Information Intelligence 
(Opta). 
• Freedom of Information (FOI) requests were submitted to the Technical Standards & 
Safety Authority (TSSA) for records related to fuel storage tanks, spills, inspections, 
environmental reports, and any other correspondence related to soil/groundwater 
contamination for the Phase One Property (13287 and 13311 Loyalist Parkway). 
• FOI requests were submitted to the MECP for documents related to various 
environmental concerns (e.g., spills, incident reports, etc.) associated with the Phase One 
Property (13287 and 13311 Loyalist Parkway). 
• A review was conducted of additional publicly available materials including, but not 
limited to, Google Earth™ satellite imagery, Ontario Well Records, and geological and 
topographic maps. 
• A review of environmental and geotechnical reports previously completed for the Phase 
One Property. 
• A site reconnaissance was completed at the Phase One Property and publicly accessible 
nearby lands. 
• An interview was conducted with the Client and two (2) individuals knowledgeable with 
the Phase One Property during the site reconnaissance. 
• The findings of the records review, site reconnaissance, and interviews were evaluated 
and presented in this report.

RECORDS REVIEW 
4.1 
General 
4.1.1  
Phase One Study Area Determination 
No potentially contaminating activities (PCAs) of concern were identified beyond 250 m of the 
Phase One Property. As such, the Phase One Study Area consisted of the Phase One Property and 
all properties located, wholly or partly, within 250 m from the nearest point of a boundary of the 
Phase One Property.  
A figure outlining the Phase One Study Area is included in Appendix B. 
4.1.2  
First Developed Use Determination 
Based on a review of available aerial photographs, the first developed use of the Phase One 
Property was a structure resembling a residential dwelling, formerly located on the north portion 
from 1929 or earlier; the structure was observed until 1987. The remaining areas of the Phase 
One Property at that time consisted of undeveloped/agricultural land. 
No records prior to the 1929 aerial photograph were available for review, and no information 
obtained during the site reconnaissance or interview process referred to the land use prior to 
1929. 
4.1.3  
Fire Insurance Plans 
No FIPs were available for the Phase One Property. 
4.1.4  
Chain of Title 
A title search was not completed. The current information available is considered sufficient to 
support a ZBA application with the municipality. Should an RSC be deemed required, a chain of 
title will need to be completed.  
4.1.5  
Environmental Reports 
The Client provided VTX with a Phase I ESA report previously completed for the Phase One 
Property. Below is a summary of pertinent details gleaned from this report. 
A Phase I ESA was completed by Stantec Consulting Ltd. (Stantec) at the Phase One Property in 
2013. At that time, the Phase One Property was developed with a No Frills grocery store and an 
RFO (No Frills at the Pumps). The fuelling infrastructure at the RFO consisted of two (2) 
underground storage tanks (USTs) and three pump islands. Both USTs had a capacity of 65,000 
litres (L) and contained gasoline in one (1) tank and gasoline/diesel in the other tank. In addition, 
a stormwater retention pond was located on the southeast portion of the Phase One Property. 
Regarding offsite operations, Stantec noted the presence of a gasoline UST on the adjacent 
property to the west (13321 Loyalist Parkway) and an Ontario Hydro operation (including a 
private fuel outlet with a 13,638 L capacity) on the neighbouring property to the north (13300 
Loyalist Parkway). The Ontario Hydro operation was also registered as a polychlorinated biphenyl 
(PCB) storage site. Stantec concluded that the Ontario Hydro operation represented an 
environmental risk to the Phase One Property.

The information in this previous report is generally consistent with VTX’s understanding of the 
PCAs at the Phase One Property and Phase One Study Area. 
4.2 
Environmental Source Information 
In addition to FOI requests submitted to the TSSA and MECP and information sourced from ERIS 
and Opta, VTX searched the MECP Access Environment online application for registrations, 
approvals, permits, and RSCs. Relevant information obtained from these sources is summarized 
in the table below.

No records found for the Phase One Property. 
1 - The TSSA was requested to search their archives for fuel storage tanks, spills, inspections, environmental 
reports, and any other correspondence related to soil/groundwater contamination at the Phase One 
Property. Note that the Fuels Safety Division of the TSSA did not register private fuel USTs or aboveground 
storage tanks (ASTs) prior to January 1990, or fuel oil tanks prior to May 1, 2002. Private waste oil tanks in 
apartments, office buildings, residences, etc. and aboveground gas or diesel tanks are not registered with the 
TSSA. In addition, private fuel outlets are not required to be registered with the TSSA; therefore, the TSSA 
has limited information on these facilities.

4.3.2  
Topography, Hydrology, Geology 
The area of the Phase One Property generally sloped downward to the south/southeast. Based 
on regional topography and nearby waterbodies, shallow groundwater in the area is inferred to 
flow in a southeasterly direction towards an unnamed tributary that eventually discharges to 
West Lake, located approximately 8 km to the west. A topographic map (Ontario Base Map series) 
is provided in Appendix E. 
It should be noted, however, that the shallow groundwater flow direction can also be altered by 
the presence of underground utility corridors and/or nearby dewatering programs and may not 
be consistent with regional or local flow regimes.

Bedrock geologic mapping of Southern Ontario indicates the Phase One Property is underlain by 
limestone, dolostone, shale, arkose, and/or sandstone. The depth to bedrock was not indicated 
on the reviewed map; however, previous geotechnical investigations completed at the Phase One 
Property encountered inferred bedrock at depths of approximately 0.33 metres below ground 
surface (mbgs) to approximately 2.9 mbgs. 
Quaternary geologic mapping of Southern Ontario indicates surficial soil at the Site consists of 
sand, gravelly sand, and gravel. The characteristic permeability of this soil is high. Previous 
geotechnical investigations at the Phase One Property encountered clayey silt, silty sand, and 
sandy silt. 
4.3.3  
Fill Materials 
Aerial photographs reviewed did not show evidence of apparent fill materials imported to the 
Phase One Property. Previous geotechnical investigations completed at the Phase One Property 
indicated that reworked soil (assumed to be native) was encountered; however, no deleterious 
fill material was noted. 
4.3.4  
Water Bodies, Areas of Natural Significance & Groundwater Information 
Water Bodies 
No water bodies were identified on the Phase One Property. An unnamed tributary is present 
approximately 160 m to the southeast of the Phase One Property. 
Areas of Natural Significance 
A map provided by ERIS indicates that no areas of natural and scientific interest were present 
within 2 km of the Phase One Property.  
Groundwater Information 
A review of the online MECP Source Protection Information Atlas indicated that the Phase One 
Property is not located within a wellhead protection area; however, it is within a highly vulnerable 
aquifer and a significant groundwater recharge area. 
A commercial water supply well was reportedly installed at or near the Phase One Property in 
1985. The current status of this well could not be confirmed.  
Multiple offsite water wells, used for either residential, commercial or agricultural purposes, 
were drilled within the Phase One Study Area during the period from 1955 to 1967. The current 
status of these wells could not be confirmed. 
4.3.5  
Well Records 
VTX searched the online MECP well record map for wells located within the Phase One Study 
Area. A water supply well (#5304488) for commercial purposes was drilled at or in the immediate 
vicinity of the south portion of the Phase One Property in 1985. The stratigraphy encountered 
during drilling consisted of brown clay to a depth of 0.6 mbgs, underlain by grey shale to 1.2 mbgs 
followed by grey limestone to 51.8 mbgs. Groundwater was reportedly encountered at 1.5 mbgs. 
Three (3) well records were filed for the adjacent property to the west (13321 Loyalist Parkway). 
The wells installed for monitoring purposes. No other information was provided regarding the

nature of the wells. VTX did not identify any PCAs in the immediate area of these wells in the 
records reviewed or during the site reconnaissance; therefore, these wells are not expected to 
be associated with a PCA that results in an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
4.4  
Site Operating Records 
An RFO is present at the Phase One Property. The RFO is a bulk liquid dispensing facility under O. 
Reg. 153/04, thus classifying the Phase One Property as an enhanced investigation property

Potentially Contaminating Activities 
One (1) spill was reported at the onsite RFO in 2015. The spill was related to a release of 
approximately 32 L of gasoline to the asphalt pavement. No catch basins were impacted. It was 
reported that the spill was contained and subsequently cleaned. The onsite RFO and reported 
gasoline spill are PCAs that have resulted in an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
A Hydro One maintenance yard was formerly present on the neighbouring property to the north 
(23 George Wright Boulevard). The yard was present from the late 1950s/early 1960s to the late 
2010s and included a building that was previously addressed as 13300 Loyalist Parkway. An MECP 
well record for this property includes a site plan that shows the approximate location of former 
USTs and “confirmed impacts”. A spill record reviewed in the ERIS report indicated that soil 
contamination was confirmed at this facility. The ERIS report also indicated that this facility 
generated hazardous wastes, was a PCB storage site, and included a private fuel outlet with a 
capacity of 13,638 L. Based on the proximity (approximately 50 m) and the upgradient location 
(groundwater is inferred to flow to the southeast), the former Hydro One operation is a PCA that 
has resulted in and/or contributed to an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
A 22,700 L single-wall steel UST containing gasoline was historically present at the adjacent 
property to the west (13321 Loyalist Parkway) and associated with the former Roseson 
Distributors Inc. operation. The UST was reportedly installed in 1980 and subsequently removed. 
10706.CA 
 
Page 12 
 
The exact location of the UST could not be ascertained based on the available information 
reviewed; therefore, the UST is a PCA that has contributed to an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
County Farm Centre Fuel, located at 38 Cold Storage Road, was listed in the ERIS report as an RFO 
with oils/fuel. Based on the separation distance (approximately 165 m to the east) and the 
inferred groundwater flow direction (southeasterly), this facility is not expected to result in soil 
or groundwater contamination at the Phase One Property. 
No additional PCAs within the Phase One Study Area are expected to result in an APEC at the 
Phase One Property due to the separation distances, nature of operations, and/or inferred 
regional groundwater flow direction.

INTERVIEWS 
VTX interviewed two (2) individuals affiliated with the Phase One Property during the site 
reconnaissance on October 3, 2023. The first interview was conducted with Mr. Kruparth, 
Manager of the on-site RFO (Mobil). The second interview was conducted with Mr. Jones, Store 
Manager for the on-site grocery store (No Frills).  
The information provided by the interviewees was reconciled with the records reviewed and is 
consistent with our understanding of the Phase One Property. VTX identified no anomalies during 
the interviews and considers the information valid for this Phase One ESA. 
In terms of PCAs and APECs at the Phase One Property, no salient information was obtained 
during the interviews that would change the nature of a PCA or APEC at the Phase One Property.

SITE RECONNAISSANCE 
6.1 
General Requirements 
On October 3, 2023, Jaegar Perna of VTX completed a site reconnaissance at the Phase One 
Property. Mr. Perna is a site assessor with six (6) years of environmental consulting experience. 
The weather was clear during the site reconnaissance with no precipitation on the ground 
surface. The site reconnaissance was conducted on foot from 9:30 am to 11:30 am. Both tenants 
of the Phase One Property (grocery store and RFO) were operating at the time of the site 
reconnaissance. 
Nearby neighbouring properties within the Phase One Study Area were also assessed during the 
site reconnaissance. Only lands that were publicly accessible were traversed to identify features 
and activities at the neighbouring properties. 
No access restrictions that would prevent the identification of a PCA were encountered during 
the assessment of the Phase One Property.  
Photographs taken during the site reconnaissance are provided in Appendix F. The photographs 
include exterior and interior portions of the Phase One Property, plus images of PCAs and/or 
APECs observed during the site reconnaissance.

Page 18 
 
aquatic centre adjacent to the east, a transformer substation adjacent to the southeast, a walking 
trail followed by undeveloped/agricultural land to the south, and a Canadian Tire store (including 
an automobile repair garage) adjacent to the west. 
The following offsite PCAs were identified: 
• transformer substation adjacent to the southeast 
• automobile repair garage on the adjacent property to the west 
• municipal roadway to the north likely requiring de-icing chemicals (salt) when snow/ice 
is present 
The above-mentioned PCAs have resulted in or contributed to APECs at the Phase One Property. 
A walking trail was located immediately south of the Phase One Property. The trail was a former 
railway line and connected with a second former railway line to the west. This former railway line 
is not expected to result in soil or groundwater contamination at the Phase One Property. 
No other offsite PCAs were observed during the site reconnaissance.

REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 
7.1 
Current and Past Uses 
The table of current and past uses of the Phase One Property, presented on the form as approved 
by the Director (MECP), is provided as Table 1 (Appendix C). The dates and names of the owners 
and the historical property uses were discerned from reviewed available records.  
Based on a review of available aerial photographs, the first developed use of the Phase One 
Property was at least 1929 (mixed agricultural and residential land use). The existing land use of 
the Phase One Property (commercial) is inferred from 2000 to present. 
7.2 
Potentially Contaminating Activity 
Identified PCAs on the Phase One Property or within the Phase One Study Area are summarized 
in Table 2 (Appendix C) and below and shown on Figure 1.  
The following on-site PCAs were identified: 
• 28-1: Gasoline and Associated Products Storage in Fixed Tanks, eastern portion of Phase 
One Property. 
• A-1: Not Specified – Known Gasoline Spill, eastern portion of Phase One Property.  
• B-1: Not Specified – Application of De-icing Substances, paved areas of Phase One 
Property.  
The following off-site PCAs were identified within the Phase One Study Area:

• C-1: Not Specified – Maintenance Yard, inferred as hydraulically upgradient and 
approximately 50 m to the north of the Phase One Property.  
• D-1: Not Specified – PCB Storage Site, inferred as hydraulically upgradient and 
approximately 50 m to the north of the Phase One Property.  
7.3 
Areas of Potential Environmental Concern 
Identified APECs on the Phase One Property are summarized on the form as approved by the 
Director (MECP) as provided in Table 3 (Appendix C) and shown on Figure 2. APECs, contaminants 
of potential concern (COPCs) and media potentially impacted were determined by the Qualified 
Person by reviewing and evaluating information made available from records, the conduct of 
interviews and the completion of a site reconnaissance.  
The identification of an APEC at the Phase One Property can only be made based on the available 
information at the time of the assessment. Available records reviewed are inherently limited in 
the information they provide, such as inferring land features from aerial photographs (e.g., 
building type and use), business operations in city directories (e.g., company name with no 
description), source of waste generation activities (e.g., HWIN registrations), site reconnaissance 
impediments (e.g., parked cars), and interviewee reliability. 
VTX submitted Freedom of Information requests to the MECP for various environmental records 
associated with the Phase One Property. VTX has not received a confirmatory response from the 
MECP at the time of issuance of this draft report. No other uncertainties or information gaps 
were noted in this Phase One ESA that could significantly affect our conclusions regarding APECs 
at the Phase One Property. 
7.4 
Phase One Conceptual Site Model 
Through the review and evaluation of available information obtained during the Phase One ESA, 
the Qualified Person has developed this Phase One CSM:

PHASE ONE CSM 
REQUIREMENT 
DISCUSSION 
Any contaminants of potential 
concern 
Table 3 provides a summary of the APECs on the Phase One Property, 
including associated COPCs and the media (groundwater, soil and/or 
sediment) that is potentially impacted.  
The potential for underground 
utilities, if any present, to affect 
contaminant 
distribution 
and 
transport 
The locations of known utilities are shown on Figure 3.  
Underground utilities present at the Phase One Property include water, 
natural gas, electricity, internet/phone, and sewer services. Storm sewer 
catch basins located in the parking lot of the grocery store connect to the 
municipal storm sewer line running along Loyalist Parkway. No drawings or 
other information were available to confirm the depths of these utilities. It 
is possible that these underground services intersect the groundwater; 
therefore, the utility corridors may act as preferential pathways for 
contaminant distribution and transport, if present, at the Phase One 
Property. 
Available regional or site specific 
geological 
or 
hydrogeological 
information  
The area of the Phase One Property generally slopes downward to the 
south/southeast. Based on regional topography and nearby waterbodies, 
shallow groundwater in the area is inferred to flow in a southeasterly 
direction towards an unnamed tributary that eventually discharges to West 
Lake, located approximately 8 km to the west. Bedrock geologic mapping of 
Southern Ontario indicates the Phase One Property is underlain by 
limestone, dolostone, shale, arkose, and/or sandstone. The depth to bedrock 
was not indicated on the reviewed map; however, previous geotechnical 
investigations completed at the Phase One Property encountered inferred 
bedrock at depths of approximately 0.33 metres below ground surface 
(mbgs) to approximately 2.9 mbgs. Quaternary geologic mapping of 
Southern Ontario indicates surficial soil at the Site consists of sand, gravelly 
sand, and gravel. Previous geotechnical investigations at the Phase One 
Property encountered clayey silt, silty sand, and sandy silt within the 
overburden. 
How any uncertainty or absence 
of information obtained in each of 
the components of the Phase One 
ESA could affect the validity of the 
model 
During the records review, VTX relied on information from various sources 
as referenced in this report. Although the information was assessed for 
consistency, verification of the accuracy or the completeness of third-party 
information was not completed.  
VTX made all reasonable inquiries to obtain accessible information as 
required by O. Reg. 153/04 Table 1: Mandatory Requirements for Phase One 
ESA Reports. Some responses or documentation (OLS Survey, Chain of Title) 
were unavailable at the issue date of this draft report. The evaluation 
provided in this report reflects the best professional judgement of VTX 
considering available information at the time of report preparation.

CONCLUSIONS 
8.1 
Whether Phase Two ESA Required Before Record of Site Condition Submitted 
Through the review of available records including but not limited to aerial photographs and an 
ERIS report, the conduct of interviews, completion of a site reconnaissance, and review and 
evaluation of information, the Qualified Person has determined that a Phase Two ESA will be 
required to support an RSC submission.  
8.2 
Record of Site Condition Based on Phase One ESA Alone 
The Qualified Person has determined that an RSC cannot be filed based on the Phase One ESA 
alone. 
8.3 
Signatures 
This Phase One ESA was undertaken under the supervision of Christopher Johnston, M.A., P.Geo. 
(Limited), QPESA, a Qualified Person per the meaning of Section 5 of Ontario Regulation 153/04.  
in accordance with the requirements of O. Reg. 153/04. Christopher is the Executive Vice 
President and a Principal Geoscientist with VTX and is licensed by the Association of Professional 
Geoscientist of Ontario to practice in environmental site assessment and remediation, including 
contaminant hydrogeology. With 24 years of experience including 14 under membership of the 
APGO, Christopher has managed hundreds of environmental investigations including Phase One 
ESAs, Phase Two ESAs and programs requiring soil and groundwater remediation and/or excess 
soil management.   
Our professional services have been performed, our findings obtained, and our 
recommendations prepared in accordance with customary principles and practices in the fields 
of environmental science and engineering. VTX made all reasonable inquiries to obtain 
reasonably accessible records pertaining to the current use or uses and all past uses of the Phase 
One Property, as per the requirements of O. Reg. 153/04. The findings within this Phase One ESA 
utilized information that was practically reviewable, meaning that only relevant data relating to 
the Phase One Property has been incorporated into the findings, disregarding extraordinary 
analysis of irrelevant data. The investigation conducted for this Phase One ESA was limited to 
data that were reasonably ascertainable, meaning that the information was publicly available 
and practically available. VTX is not responsible for the independent conclusions, opinions, or 
recommendations made by others based on the records review, site visit, field exploration, and 
laboratory test data presented in this report. 
It should be noted that all surficial environmental assessments are inherently limited in the sense 
that conclusions are drawn, and recommendations developed from information obtained from 
limited research and site evaluation. Subsurface conditions were not field investigated as part of 
this study and may differ from the conditions implied by the surficial observations. Additionally, 
the passage of time may result in a change in the environmental characteristics at the Phase One 
Property and surrounding properties. VTX does not warrant against future operations or 
conditions, or against operations or conditions present of a type or at a location not investigated. 
VTX does not assume responsibility for other environmental issues that may be associated with 
the Phase One Property. 
10706.CA
Page 24
This study is not intended to assess or otherwise determine if soil contamination, waste 
emplacement, or groundwater contamination exists. These data are accessible only by sampling 
of subsurface material and groundwater through the completion of soil borings or test pit 
excavations and the installation of monitoring wells and the chemical analyses of soil and 
groundwater samples. The scope of work, determined by the Client, did not include these 
activities.
In view of the rapidly changing status of environmental laws, regulations, and guidelines, VTX 
cannot be responsible for changes in laws, regulations, or guidelines that occur after the study 
has been completed and that may affect the Phase One Property. 
It must be noted that no investigation can absolutely rule out the existence of hazardous 
materials at a given property. This assessment has been based upon prior site history and 
observable conditions. Existing hazardous materials and contaminants can escape detection 
using these methods.
Our conclusions regarding the potential environmental impact of nearby, offsite facilities on the 
Phase One Property are based on readily available information from the environmental 
databases and the assumed groundwater flow direction as inferred from the topography of the 
Phase One Property and surrounding area. A detailed file review of each facility was beyond the 
scope of work.

Table 2: Potentially Contaminating Activities 
PHASE ONE PROPERTY 
SCHEDULE D IDENTIFIER 
VTX IDENTIFIER 
POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATING ACTIVITY 
28 - Gasoline and Associated 
Products Storage in Fixed Tanks 
28-1 
A retail fuel outlet (RFO) is present on the east portion of the Phase One Property. The gas bar 
consisted of two 60,000 L double-wall fiberglass-reinforced plastic USTs. Each UST is a compartment 
tank constructed with two (2) chambers. One (1) tank contained 45,000 L of regular gasoline and 
20,000 L of premium gasoline, and the other tank contained 45,000 L of gasoline and 20,000 L of 
diesel. This gas bar is a PCA that contributes to an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC 1). 
N/S – Known Gasoline Spill 
A-1 
One (1) spill was reported at the Phase One Property in 2015. The spill was related to a release of 
approximately 32 L of gasoline to the asphalt pavement at the onsite RFO. It was reported that the 
spill was contained and subsequently cleaned. This spill is a PCA that contributes to an APEC at the 
Phase One Property (APEC 2). 
N/S - Application of De-icing 
Agents 
B-1 
VTX understands that de-icing chemicals (salt) are applied to the parking lot when snow and/or ice is 
present. No bulk storage of salt products was observed at the Phase One Property. The application of 
de-icing chemicals (salt) is a PCA that results in an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC 3). 
PHASE ONE STUDY AREA 
SCHEDULE D IDENTIFIER 
VTX IDENTIFIER 
POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATING ACTIVITY 
27 - Garages and Maintenance 
and Repair of Railcars, Marine 
Vehicles and Aviation Vehicles 
27-1 
A Canadian Tire store is located on the adjacent property to the west (13321 Loyalist Parkway). The 
store includes an automobile repair garage within the west portion of the building. Based on the 
close proximity, this automobile repair garage is a PCA that contributes to an APEC at the Phase One 
Property (APEC 5). 
28 - Gasoline and Associated 
Products Storage in Fixed Tanks 
28-2 
A 22,700 L single-wall steel UST containing gasoline was historically present at the adjacent property 
to the west (13321 Loyalist Parkway). The UST was reportedly installed in 1980 and subsequently 
removed (date unknown). The exact location of the UST could not be ascertained based on the 
available information reviewed; therefore, the UST is a PCA that contributes to an APEC at the Phase 
One Property (APEC 5). 
28 - Gasoline and Associated 
Products Storage in Fixed Tanks 
28-3 
A Hydro One maintenance building and yard were formerly present on the neighbouring property to 
the north (23 George Wright Boulevard). The operation was previously addressed as 13300 Loyalist 
Parkway and was active from the late 1950/early 1960s to the late 2010s. An MECP well record 
registered at this property includes a figure that illustrates the approximate location of former USTs 
and “confirmed impacts”. The ERIS report noted that a private fuel outlet with a capacity of 13,638 L 
was present at this property. Based on the proximity (approximately 50 m) and the upgradient 
location (groundwater is inferred to flow to the southeast), the USTs associated with this former 
Hydro One operation are a PCA that contribute to an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC 4). 
 
28 - Gasoline and Associated 
Products Storage in Fixed Tanks 
28-4 
County Farm Centre Fuel, located at 38 Cold Storage Road, was listed in the ERIS report as an RFO 
with oils/fuel. Based on the separation distance (approximately 165 m to the east) and the inferred 
groundwater flow direction (southeasterly), this facility is not expected to result in soil or 
groundwater contamination at the Phase One Property. 
46 - Rail Yards, Tracks and Spurs 
46-1 
A walking trail was located immediately south of the Phase One Property. The trail was a former 
railway line and is not expected to result in soil or groundwater contamination at the Phase One 
Property. 
46 - Rail Yards, Tracks and Spurs 
46-2 
A walking trail was located approximately 125 m west of the Phase One Property. The trail was a 
former railway line and is not expected to result in soil or groundwater contamination at the Phase 
One Property. 
55 - Transformer Manufacturing, 
Processing and Use 
55-1 
A transformer substation is located immediately southeast of the Phase One Property. The 
substation has been present since the 1960s/1970s. Based on the close proximity, the substation is a 
PCA that has resulted in an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC 6). 
N/S – Known Contamination 
A-2 
A Hydro One maintenance yard was formerly present on the neighbouring property to the north (23 
George Wright Boulevard). The yard was present from the late 1950s/early 1960s to the late 2010s 
and included a building that was previously addressed as 13300 Loyalist Parkway. An MECP well 
record for this property includes a site plan that shows the approximate location of former USTs and 
“confirmed impacts”. A spill record reviewed in the ERIS report indicated that soil contamination was 
confirmed at this facility. Based on the proximity (approximately 50 m) and the upgradient location 
(groundwater is inferred to flow to the southeast), the known contamination historically at this 
property is a PCA that contributes to an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC 4). 
N/S - Application of De-icing 
Agents 
B-2 
De-icing chemicals (salt) are typically applied to municipal roadways when snow and/or ice is 
present. The application of de-icing chemicals (salt) along Loyalist Parkway to the north is a PCA that 
contributes to an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC 4). 
N/S – Hydro One Maintenance 
Yard 
C-1 
A Hydro One maintenance yard was formerly present on the neighbouring property to the north (23 
George Wright Boulevard). The yard was present from the late 1950s/early 1960s to the late 2010s 
and included a building that was previously addressed as 13300 Loyalist Parkway. The ERIS report 
indicated that this facility generated hazardous wastes. Based on the proximity (approximately 50 m) 
and the upgradient location (groundwater is inferred to flow to the southeast), the former Hydro 
One operation is a PCA that contributes to an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC 4). 
N/S – PCB Storage Site 
D-1 
A Hydro One maintenance yard was formerly present on the neighbouring property to the north (23 
George Wright Boulevard). The yard was present from the late 1950s/early 1960s to the late 2010s 
and included a building that was previously addressed as 13300 Loyalist Parkway. The ERIS report 
indicated that this facility was a PCB storage site. Based on the proximity (approximately 50 m) and 
the upgradient location (groundwater is inferred to flow to the southeast), the PCB Storage Site 
registration is a PCA that contributes to an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC 4).

RE: CITY DIRECTORY RESEARCH 
13311 Loyalist Parkway
Picton,ON K0K 2T0
Thank you for contacting ERIS regarding our City Directory Search services. Our staff has conducted a reverse listing
City Directory search to determine prior occupants of the subject site and adjacent properties. When searching a
range of addresses, all civic addresses within that range found in the Directory are included.
Note: Reverse Listing Directories generally are focused on highly developed areas, while newly developed areas may
be covered in the more recent years, older directories tend to cover only "central" parts of the city. To complete the
search, we have either utilized the Toronto Reference Library, Library & Archives Canada and multiple digitized
directories. While these do not claim to be a complete collection of all reverse listing city directories produced, ERIS
has made every effort to provide accurate and complete information. ERIS shall not be held liable for missing,
incomplete, or inaccurate information. If you believe there are additional addresses or streets that require
searching, please contact us.
Search Criteria:
13311 of Loyalist Parkway
13260 of Loyalist Parkway
13251 of Loyalist Parkway
13257 of Loyalist Parkway
13263 of Loyalist Parkway

Mineral Occurrences:
Provincial
rr-MNR-bb
In the early 70's, the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines created an inventory of approximately 19,000 mineral occurrences in Ontario, in 
regard to metallic and industrial minerals, as well as some information on building stones and aggregate deposits.  Please note that the "Horizontal 
Positional Accuracy" is approximately +/- 200 m.  Many reference elements for each record were derived from field sketches using pace or chain/tape 
measurements against claim posts or topographic features in the area.  The primary limiting factor for the level of positional accuracy is the scale of the 
source material. The testing of horizontal accuracy of the source materials was accomplished by comparing the plan metric (X and Y) coordinates of that
point with the coordinates of the same point as defined from a source of higher accuracy.

National Environmental Emergencies System (NEES):
Federal
rr-NEES-bb
In 2000, the Emergencies program implemented NEES, a reporting system for spills of hazardous substances.  For the most part, this system only 
captured data from the Atlantic Provinces, some from Quebec and Ontario and a portion from British Columbia. Data for Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and the Territories was not captured. However, NEES is also a repository for previous Environment Canada spill datasets.  NEES is 
composed of the historic datasets ' or Trends ' which dates from approximately 1974 to present. NEES Trends is a compilation of historic databases, 
which were merged and includes data from NATES (National Analysis of Trends in Emergencies System), ARTS (Atlantic Regional Trends System), 
and NEES.  In 2001, the Emergencies Program determined that variations in reporting regimes and requirements between federal and provincial 
agencies made national spill reporting and trend analysis difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the department has focused efforts on capturing data 
on spills of substances which fall under its legislative authority only (CEPA and FA). As such, the NEES database will be decommissioned in December 
2004.

Database Descriptions: This section provides a detailed explanation for each database including: source, information available, time coverage, and
acronyms used. They are listed in alphabetic order.
Detail Report: This is the section of the report which provides the most detail for each individual record. Records are summarized by location, starting
with the project property followed by records in closest proximity.
Distance: The distance value is the distance between plotted points, not necessarily the distance between the sites' boundaries. All values are an
approximation.
Direction:  The direction value is the compass direction of the site in respect to the project property and/or center point of the report.
Elevation: The elevation value is taken from the location at which the records for the site address have been plotted. All values are an approximation.
Source: Google Elevation API.
Executive Summary: This portion of the report is divided into 3 sections:
'Report Summary'- Displays a chart indicating how many records fall on the project property and, within the report search radii.
'Site Report Summary'-Project Property'- This section lists all the records which fall on the project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report'
section.
'Site Report Summary-Surrounding Properties'- This section summarizes all records on adjacent properties, listing them in order of proximity from the
project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report' section.
Map Key: The map key number is assigned according to closest proximity from the project property. Map Key numbers always start at #1. The project
property will always have a map key of '1' if records are available. If there is a number in brackets beside the main number, this will indicate the number
of records on that specific property. If there is no number in brackets, there is only one record for that property.
The symbol and colour used indicates 'elevation': the red inverted triangle will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Lower Elevation', the yellow triangle will dictate
'ERIS Sites with Higher Elevation' and the orange square will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Same Elevation.'
Unplottables: These are records that could not be mapped due to various reasons, including limited geographic information. These records may or
may not be in your study area, and are included as reference.
