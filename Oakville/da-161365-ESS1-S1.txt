EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Stantec Consulting Ltd. (Stantec) was retained by Transmetro Limited (Transmetro) to conduct a Phase 
One Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the property located at 358 Reynolds Street (Phase One 
Property) in Oakville, Ontario.  
The Phase One ESA was completed to determine if Areas of Potential Environmental Concern (APECs) 
exist at the Phase One Property, which may be present as a result of current and/or past potentially 
contaminating activities (PCAs) on the Phase One Property or nearby properties within 250 m of the 
perimeter of the Phase One Property (Phase One Study Area). Stantec understands that the Phase One 
ESA is required to support the redevelopment of the Phase One Property from the current commercial 
land use to a residential land use, which would require the filing of a Record of Site Condition (RSC) 
under Ontario Regulation 153/04 (O.Reg.153/04).   
A site survey is provided in Appendix A, while site plans showing the Phase One Study Area and Phase 
One Property are included in Appendix B.  
PHASE ONE PROPERTY INFORMATION 
At the time of the site visit, a vacant three-storey former Medical Arts building and its associated asphalt 
parking lot occupied the Phase One Property.   
Based on information provided during the interview, and as confirmed in previous reports provided by 
Transmetro, the building on the Phase One Property was built in 1955 (RSA, 2014) and the first use was 
residential apartments. An addition to the rear of the building in 1965 included the installation of an 
elevator. The building was converted to a medical office in the late 1970s. In 2012, a 4,500 litre heating oil 
underground storage tank (UST) was removed. The UST was reported to be in poor condition and 
resulted in heating oil leaking from the UST and contaminating surrounding soil. As a result, a total of 
approximately 170.31 tonnes of contaminated soils from the initial remedial excavation were removed at 
that time. The presence of a former UST and knowledge of soil contamination represents a PCA which 
has contributed to an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC-1).  
Fill materials were previously imported to the Site to backfill the remedial excavation for the former UST. 
Chemical analysis results for this fill material were not available for review during the Phase One ESA. 
The presence of fill of an unknown environmental quality represents a PCA which has contributed to an 
APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC-2). 
The paved parking areas of the Phase One Property have had deicing compounds applied in the past for 
the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic under conditions of snow or ice or both. Based on the 
presence of these deicing compounds, this area of the Phase One Property is considered to be an APEC 
(APEC-4).

PHASE ONE STUDY AREA 
Two 10,000-gallon fuel oil USTs were identified northeast of the Phase One Property across Reynolds 
Street on the Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital property. The historical presence of USTs upgradient 
of the Phase One Property represents a PCA with the potential to contribute to APEC at the Phase One 
Property (APEC-3).  
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Phase One ESA has revealed PCAs at the Phase One Property and within the Phase One Study 
Area that have contributed to APECs at the Site. The table below and Figure No. 3 summarize the 
identified APECs and related PCAs:

2 As per paragraph 1 of section 49.1 of Ontario Regulation 153/04, further assessment of this APEC for the above-noted 
contaminants of potential concern is not considered warranted during a Phase Two ESA due to the application of salt/deicing 
compounds to the parking surfaces at the Phase One Property for the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic under conditions 
of snow or ice or both.

PHASE ONE PROPERTY INFORMATION 
Stantec Consulting Ltd. (Stantec) was retained by Transmetro Limited (Transmetro) to conduct a Phase 
One Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the property located at 358 Reynolds Street (Phase One 
Property) in Oakville, Ontario.  
The Phase One ESA was completed to determine if Areas of Potential Environmental Concern (APECs) 
exist at the Phase One Property, which may be present as a result of current and/or past potentially 
contaminating activities (PCAs) on the Phase One Property or nearby properties within 250 m of the 
perimeter of the Phase One Property (Phase One Study Area). Stantec understands that the Phase One 
ESA is required to support the redevelopment of the Phase One Property from the current commercial 
land use to a residential land use, which would require the filing of a Record of Site Condition (RSC) 
under Ontario Regulation 153/04 (O.Reg.153/04).   
A site survey is provided in Appendix A, while site plans showing the Phase One Study Area and Phase

SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION 
3.1 
SCOPE OF WORK 
The Phase One ESA was completed to determine if APECs exist at the Phase One Property, which may 
be present as a result of current and/or past PCAs on the Phase One Property or nearby properties within 
250 m of the perimeter of the Phase One Property (Phase One Study Area). Stantec understands the 
filing of a RSC under O.Reg.153/04 will be required. The objectives of the Phase One ESA included the 
following: 
• 
To develop a preliminary determination of the likelihood that one or more contaminants have affected 
any land or water on, in or under the Phase One Property. 
• 
To assess the need for a Phase Two ESA. 
• 
To provide a basis for carrying out a Phase Two ESA, if necessary. 
• 
To provide adequate preliminary information about environmental conditions in the land or water on, 
in or under the Phase One Property to conduct a risk assessment following completion of a Phase 
Two ESA, if necessary. 
The Phase One ESA is intended to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, uncertainty regarding the 
potential for contamination at a property. The Phase One ESA carried out by Stantec on this property 
generally satisfies the requirements of O.Reg.153/04 and consisted of the following: 
• 
A review of records that included, but was not limited to, the following where available: 
o 
Review of publicly available aerial photographs, city directories, fire insurance plans (FIPs), 
geological and topographic maps  
o 
A land title search back to crown ownership for the Phase One Property   
o 
Purchase of an ERIS report consisting of a search of available databases within the Phase One 
Study Area 
o 
Request to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) for 
documents related to various environmental concerns (e.g., spills, incident reports, etc.) 
pertaining to the Phase One Property  
o 
Request to the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) for available tank records for 
the Phase One Property 
o 
Request to Opta Information Intelligence (Opta) for fire insurance plans and/or property 
underwriters' reports/plans available for the Phase One Property 
o 
Company records and previous reports provided by Transmetro 
o 
Other available environmental databases and records, as applicable 
• 
An interview with an individual having knowledge of the Phase One Property.

• 
A site reconnaissance to identify PCAs associated with: 
o 
Current on-site operations 
o 
Waste generation 
o 
Fuel, chemical and waste storage 
o 
Exterior conditions including surface features, fill material and wells 
o 
Off-site activities and operations 
• 
Evaluation of information from records reviewed, interviews and site reconnaissance. 
• 
Preparation of a Phase One ESA report. 
A Phase One ESA does not include sampling or testing of air, soil, ground water, surface water or 
building materials. This assessment did not include a review or audit of compliance with any 
environmental legislation applicable to the Phase One Property, or of any environmental management 
systems which may exist for the Phase One Property. 
A site reconnaissance was conducted at the Phase One Property by Mr. Aseel Kaiser of Stantec on 
December 23, 2019. The Phase One Property and readily visible and publicly accessible portions of 
nearby properties within the Phase One Study Area were observed for PCAs. The former medical arts 
building was accessed. Stantec was accompanied by Mr. Lihou of Transmetro during the site visit. An 
interview was carried out with Mr. Lihou (as described in Section 5.0), during the site reconnaissance to 
obtain or confirm information on the current and former operations at the Phase One Property. Pertinent 
details obtained from the interview are included in the applicable sections of this report. 
3.2 
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 
In Ontario, the roles and powers of the MECP when dealing with contaminated sites are outlined primarily 
in the Environmental Protection Act (R.S.O. 1990). The MECP has a mandate to address conditions 
where there is an adverse effect, or the likelihood of an adverse effect, associated with the presence or 
discharge of a contaminant. Ontario Regulation (O.Reg.) 153/04 provides roles and responsibilities for 
property owners and consultants to use when assessing the environmental condition of a property when 
determining whether restoration is required and in determining the kind of restoration needed to allow 
continued use or reuse of a property. The regulation includes generic numerical standards for soil and 
groundwater quality for specific land and groundwater uses. A Phase One ESA is an initial step in the site 
assessment process, which may lead to the requirement for restoration work if areas of potential 
environmental contamination are identified. During a Phase One ESA, samples are not collected; 
however, if there are previous soil or groundwater sample results available, the results are compared to 
applicable Ontario site condition standards.

RECORDS REVIEW 
4.1 
GENERAL 
4.1.1 
Phase One Study Area Determination 
The Phase One Study Area included the Phase One Property, properties immediately adjoining the 
Phase One Property, and neighbouring properties located wholly or partially within 250 m from the 
nearest point on the boundary of the Phase One Property. No properties located farther than 250 m from 
the Phase One Property were identified as PCAs that may contribute to an APEC at the Phase One 
Property. 
4.1.2 
First Developed Use Determination 
The first developed use of the Phase One Property was determined through a review of the following 
historical sources and additional resources as listed in Table 9 at the end of this report: 
• 
Aerial photographs taken in 1934, 1954, 1960, 1968, 1974, and 1988 
• 
Town of Oakville imagery from 1995 to 2015 (not inclusive) 
• 
Google Earth imagery from 2017 and 2018 
• 
City directories from 1958 to 2000 
In addition, a chain of title for the Phase One Property was received (see copy provided in Appendix E).  
At the time of the site visit, a vacant three-storey former Medical Arts building and its associated asphalt 
parking lot occupied the Phase One Property.   
 
Based on information provided during the interview, and as confirmed in previous reports provided by 
Transmetro, the building on the Phase One Property was built in 1955 (RSA, 2014) and the first use was 
residential apartments. An addition to the rear of the building in 1965 included the installation of an 
elevator. According to aerial imagery, the current building configuration remains the same as was noted in 
the 1968 aerial photograph. The building was converted to a medical office in the late 1970s. The building 
was again renovated in 2014 before closing its doors to the public in 2017. The first developed use of the 
Phase One Property was determined to be as a residential apartment building in 1955.  
A Service Ontario Parcel Register document received for the Phase One Property indicated the following

Fire Insurance Plans 
FIPs pertaining to the Phase One Property and Phase One Study Area were requested from Opta. Opta 
provided FIPs dated 1913, 1932, and 1967, excerpts of which are provided in Appendix E. PCAs 
associated with historical off-site activities are shown on Figure No.2 and PCAs and relevant site features 
associated with historical on-site activities are shown on Figure No.3.  
1913 FIP 
The available 1913 FIP did not cover the Phase One Property, instead it covered the area south, west, 
and southwest of the Phase One Property. Of note, were scattered logs and buildings assumed to be 
associated with the Oakville Basket Company operations located south of Dundas Street along Sixteen 
Mile Creek.  
1932 FIP 
The available 1932 FIP covered the Phase One Property and Phase One Study Area. The Phase One 
Property was vacant in 1932. No PCAs that would represent an APEC on the Phase One Property were 
identified within the Phase One Study Area.  
1967 FIP 
The available 1967 FIP covered the Phase One Property and the northeast portion of the Phase One 
Study Area that encompassed the Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital and the Church property, west of 
the Phase One Property, at the corner of Reynolds Street and Spruce Street.  
The current configuration of the medical arts building on the Phase One Property is present in the 1967 
FIP.  
Two 10,000-gallon fuel oil USTs were identified immediately northeast of the Phase One Property across 
Reynolds Street on the Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital property. The historical presence of USTs 
upgradient of the Phase One Property represents a PCA with the potential to contribute to an APEC at 
the Phase One Property (APEC-3).  
The results of the Opta search are included in Appendix E.  
4.1.4 
Chain of Title 
A chain of title from July 1856 to present day for the Phase One Property was received and used to 
compile the First Developed Use Determination in Section 4.1.2 above. A copy of the chain of title is 
included in Appendix E.

Environmental Reports 
The following environmental reports were provided to Stantec for review.  
“Environmental Inspection and Testing Services, Oakville Medical Arts Building, 358 Reynolds Street, 
Oakville, Ontario”, prepared by AiMS Environmental for Dr. Ross Prince of 589027 Ontario Inc. March 2, 
2013.  
AiMS Environmental provided a factual report documenting the removal of an UST and the remediation of 
petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) impacted soils and groundwater at the Phase One Property. AiMS 
Environmental previously completed a Phase I ESA in September 2012, during which they observed a 
vent pipe associated with a heating oil UST, entering the ground along the west building wall. As a result, 
AiMS Environmental completed a Phase II ESA in October 2012. Five exterior boreholes were drilled 
across the Phase One Property, ranging in depths from 3.8 metres to 4.6 metres below ground surface 
(m BGS). Two of these boreholes were completed as monitoring wells. Soil samples were analyzed for 
PHCs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
and compared to the Ontario 2011 Table 3 site condition standards (SCS). Concentrations of analyzed 
parameters in the soil samples were less than the applicable standard with the exception of one soil 
sample from BH5 which had PHC F1 to F3 and PAH exceedances. PHC odours and a sheen were noted 
on the surface of groundwater purged from monitoring well MW4.  
The 4,500 litre (L) (1,000-gallon) heating oil UST was removed on December 12 and 13, 2012, by Val 
Environmental Inc., according to the TSSA protocol. A total of 3,800 L of residential heating oil and water 
was removed from the UST. During an inspection of the UST, surficial corrosion and small cracks were 
observed. A total of 170.31 tonnes of contaminated soils from the initial excavation were shipped off-site 
for disposal. Twenty-six soil samples were collected from the initial excavation, one of which (depth of 3 m 
BGS) had a concentration of PHC F2 that exceeded the applicable criteria. AiMS Environmental returned 
to the Phase One Property on December 18, 2012 to widen the excavation to remove the soil with the 
identified exceedance. Once all identified soil contamination was removed off-site, the remediation focus 
became the contaminated groundwater at MW4. Two ground water samples were collected from MW4 in 
January 2013 and both had concentrations of PHCs that exceeded the applicable standard. As a result, 
approximately 4,000 L was purged from this well prior to collecting a third sample in February 2013. This 
sample had PHC concentrations less than the Table 3 standard. Quarterly monitoring, purging, and 
sampling of MW4 was recommended.

Engineering Corporation for TransMetro Limited. June 27, 2017 (note: July 17, 2017 date also used in 
footer of report).  
This document summaries the soil and groundwater sampling protocols used at the Phase One Property. 
No sample analytical results were provided.  No date was provided to reference when the soil sampling at 
the site occurred; groundwater sampling was reportedly completed on June 7, 2017.  
“Environmental Condition of 358 Reynolds Street, Oakville, Ontario”, prepared by Maat Environmental 
Engineering Corporation for Trontar Ltd. July 31, 2017.  
This document provides the results of a soil sampling program completed on July 25, 2017. During this 
program, two soil samples (TP-1 and TP-2) were recovered from the Phase One Property in an effort to 
further define the area of contamination at the Site. Both soil samples were recovered approximately 1.5 
m BGS and were located directly east of MW-5 within the basement of the building. Analytical results 
indicated no detections of PHC parameters. Thus, Maat Environmental stated “it is believed that the soil 
impact does not extend further to the east of MW5. It could not be confirmed that the groundwater was 
free of contamination in the area of the test pits.”   
“Remediation Proposal, 358 Reynolds Street, Oakville, Ontario”, prepared by Maat Environmental 
Engineering Corporation for Steven Yan. September 11, 2017.  
This document summaries investigative work completed at the Phase One Property between June 7 and 
August 22, 2017. The work included the following activities:  
• 
Sampling of previously installed monitoring wells MW3 and MW5. Samples were analyzed for 
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), PHC F1 to F4, and PAHs. PHC F2 and F3 
exceedances of Table 3 standards were identified at MW5.  
• 
As a result of exceedances in groundwater at MW5, four additional boreholes (BH1 to BH4), three 
of which (BH1, BH2, and BH4) were completed as monitoring wells, were advanced at the Phase 
One Property. None of the soil and groundwater samples recovered from BH1 to BH4 had 
concentrations of analyzed parameters greater than the Table 3 standards.  
• 
Two additional samples were collected beneath the floor slab (1.5 m BGS) in the furnace room of 
the Phase One Property. These samples were identified as TP-1 and TP-2. Analytical results 
confirmed no detections of PHC F2 to F4 in these two soil samples.  
• 
On August 23, 2017, an attempt was made to remove contaminated soils adjacent to the footing 
of the southwest corner of the Phase One building. However, the foundation wall was observed to 
be in poor condition thus it was not safe to excavate the area immediately adjacent to the

Compliance Approval (ECA) databases for properties within the Phase One Study Area. No CofAs were 
identified for the Phase One Property.  
The Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital (327 Reynolds Street) was listed as being approved in 1993, 
1996, and 1998 for an industrial air CofA for ethylene oxide (ETO) catalytic disposer and area exhaust, 
ETO sterilizer, and existing boiler and emergency generator. No additional information was provided.  
Additionally, the Town of Oakville was approved for a municipal sewage CofA in 1988. These entries are 
not expected to represent a PCA that would contribute to an APEC for the Phase One Property.  
4.2.6 
MECP Freedom of Information Requests 
A request submitted to the MECP's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Office included a 
search for occurrence reports and general information from the District Office, investigation documents 
from the Investigations and Enforcement Branch, waste generator information from the Environmental 
Monitoring and Reporting Branch, Certificates of Approval from the Environmental Assessment and 
Approvals Branch, and orders from the Sector Compliance Branch pertaining to the municipal address of 
the Site and current/former tenants and owners of the Site. 
The documentation provided from the MECP included an incident report dated December 12, 2012. The 
incident report details the discovery of a UST leak. Various Hazardous Waste Information Network 
(HWIN) registrations that included waste classes 312-P (pathological), 251-L (oil skimmings and sludges), 
252-L (waste oils), and 221-L (light fuels) were provided. The final piece of information was a letter from 
the Ministry of the Environment dated April 9, 1990, acknowledging the waste registration of spent xylene 
and methanol solvents (211-H and 212-H). This waste generator information is attributed to elevator 
servicing (oils) and medical offices at the Site. The information received from the MECP is consistent with 
other information available for the Phase One ESA and did not result in changes to the findings and 
conclusions of this report.  
A copy of the response from the MECP is provided in Appendix E.

Stantec reviewed the report titled Inventory of Industrial Sites Producing or Using Coal Tar and Related 
Tars in Ontario, (Volumes I and II), dated November 1988, prepared by Intera Technologies Ltd. for the 
MOECC. The documents identify industrial sites that produced and/or continue to produce or use coal tar 
and other related tars. No properties within 1 km of the Phase One Property were listed as industrial sites 
producing or using coal tar. 
4.2.9 
Hazardous Waste Generators and Receivers 
Included in the ERIS report was a search of the Ontario Regulation 347 Waste Generators and the 
Ontario Regulation 347 Waste Receivers databases for properties within the Phase One Study Area.  
In 2015, Direct Elevator Service Ltd. was registered at the Phase One Property for generation of waste 
oils and lubricants and oil skimmings and sludges associated with the operation of an elevator. In 
addition, the Phase One Property was registered as a waste generator of light fuels, pathological wastes, 
aromatic and aliphatic solvents between 1989 and 2018. Based on the listed waste classes, this waste 
generation appeared to be associated with offices of health practitioners including medical and diagnostic 
laboratories. Former waste generation at the Phase One Property was assumed to be minimal and is not 
considered a PCA contributing to an APEC on the Phase One Property.  
Surrounding properties are discussed in Section 5.3.  
4.2.10 Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) 
A request was made to the TSSA for a search of their files regarding tank installations, fueling facilities, 
outstanding instructions, incident reports, fuel oil spills and/or contamination records for the Phase One

4.2.13 Areas of Natural Significance (ANSI) 
Stantec completed an Environmentally Sensitive Areas search to determine if any Areas of Natural 
Significance, as defined in O.Reg.153/04, are present within the Phase One Study Area. The search 
included the review of information provided by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). The 
ANSI map provided by MNR, dated March 2017, indicated that the Phase One Property is not considered 
to be located within an Area of Natural Significance.  
4.2.14 Waste Disposal Sites 
Stantec reviewed the information contained in the MECP document titled Waste Disposal Site Inventory, 
dated June 1991. The report includes a list of known active and closed waste disposal sites in Ontario, as 
of October 31, 1990. Based on the information reviewed, no properties within 1 km of the Phase One 
Property were listed as active or closed landfill sites. 
In addition, included in the ERIS report was a search of the Waste Disposal Sites and Anderson’s Waste 
Disposal Sites databases for properties within the Phase One Study Area. No properties within the Phase 
One Study Area were listed in the database. 
4.2.15 ERIS Report 
An ERIS report was obtained as part of the Phase One ESA. The report consisted of a search of 
available databases (including unplottable records) within a 250 m radius of the perimeter of the Phase 
One Property. Records of environmental significance within the Phase One Study Area, which are not 
discussed elsewhere in this report, are summarized in the table below:

Summary 
Phase One Property 
• 
Three water wells were reportedly installed on the Phase One Property in 
2017. This is consistent with a historical report by Maat Environmental which 
identifies these three wells as BH1, BH2, and BH4. The wells are not 
considered PCAs contributing to an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
• 
A fuel oil leak was reported during the December 12, 2012 UST removal 
program. Historical reports confirm this tank was in poor condition resulting in 
a leak of fuel oil. Contaminated soil and groundwater have been identified as 
a result. Thus, the fuel oil leak represents a PCA contributing to an APEC at 
the Phase One Property (APEC-1).  
384 Reynolds Street (70 m 
northwest of the Phase One 
Property) 
• 
A & T Custom Mirrors was listed on the manufactures database in 1986 for 
the manufacturing of wood household furniture, except upholster and glass 
products made of purchased glass. Due to the nature of manufacturing 
occurring at 384 Reynolds Street, it is not considered a PCA likely to 
contribute to an APEC at the Phase One Property.

Summary 
344 Reynolds Street (20 m 
southeast of the Phase One 
Property) 
• 
A TSSA Historic Incident occurred at 344 Reynolds Street when an incident or 
near miss occurrence involving a gaseous fuel occurred. No date was 
provided. An incident with a gaseous fuel is not considered a PCA 
contributing to an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
327 Reynolds Street (15 m 
north of the Phase One 
Property) 
• 
The Oakville–Trafalgar Memorial Hospital was listed on the National PCB 
Inventory database as well as the Ontario Inventory of PCB Storage Sites 
between 1991 and 2004. 327 Reynolds Street was listed to have capacitors, 
bulk liquid, and transformers with high level PCBs and drums of ballasts and 
drums of other material with both high and low-level PCBs. As PCBs are 
generally localized and do not migrate easily, the historical presence of PCB 
material and a PCB storage facility was considered a PCA not contributing to 
an APEC at the Phase One Property.  
• 
The Oakville–Trafalgar Memorial Hospital was listed as a waste generator of 
alkaline solutions, inorganic sludges, slurries, or solids, aliphatic solvents and 
residues, light fuels, PCBs, petroleum-based waste oils and sludges, waste 
crankcase oils and lubricants, halogenated solvents, waste compressed 
gases, organic and inorganic laboratory chemicals, alkaline wastes, 
pathological wastes, paint/pigment/coating residues, acid waste, organic 
acids, aromatic solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The wastes generated are 
associated with the operation of a hospital and ambulatory health care 
services, however the areas of this property where wastes could be stored or 
processed is further east and away from the Phase One Property. Thus the 
historical waste generation is not considered a PCA contributing to an APEC 
at the Phase One Property. 
291 Reynolds Street (180 m 
southeast of the Phase One 
Property) 
• 
The Halton Board of Education was listed as a waste generator of inorganic 
and organic laboratory chemicals, aromatic solvents, petroleum distillates, oil 
skimmings and sludges, waste oils and lubricants. The nature of the waste 
generation appears to be associated with schools. Thus, the anticipated 
volume of waste generated is minimal and not considered to represent a PCA 
likely to contribute to an APEC at the Phase One Property.  
271 MacDonald Road (20 m 
west of from the Phase One 
Property) 
• 
Two Union Gas Limited natural gas leaks occurred at 271 MacDonald Road 
on June 26, 2018 and April 25, 2019. Both leaks were a result of an 
operational error. As the leaks were to the atmosphere, they are not 
considered a PCA contributing to an APEC at the Phase One Property.  
397 Trafalgar Road (155 m 
southwest of the Phase One 
Property) 
• 
A Union Gas Limited natural gas leak due to operational error occurred on 
October 13, 2016. 1 L of methane was estimated to be released to the 
atmosphere.  
• 
A Union Gas Limited pipeline was struck on October 24, 2016. No other 
details were provided.  
• 
Natural gas pipeline leaks result in methane being released to the 
atmosphere, which is not considered a PCA contributing to an APEC at the 
Phase One Property.  
337 Trafalgar Road (20 m 
east and southeast of the 
Phase One Property) 
• 
Between 2005 and 2019, MacLachlan College was registered as a waste 
generator of organic and inorganic laboratory chemicals, waste compressed 
gases, paint/pigment/coating residues, and acid waste associated with 
schools and instruction. Thus, the anticipated volume of waste generated is 
minimal and not considered to represent a PCA likely to contribute to an 
APEC at the Phase One Property.

On May 7, 2013, a Union Gas Limited natural gas leak occurred due to a line 
strike.  
• 
On January 16, 2014, a Union Gas Limited pipeline incident occurred when 
locates were not obtained prior to digging.

The remaining listings in the ERIS report are not expected to represent PCAs that would contribute to an 
APEC at the Phase One Property based on the nature of their operations and/or the separation 
distances. In addition, numerous unplottable entries were listed in the ERIS report. Although the exact 
location of these entries could not be determined, based on the nature of the records and/or location 
information provided, these records are not expected to represent PCAs that could contribute to an APEC

PHYSICAL SETTING SOURCES 
4.3.1 
Aerial Photographs 
Stantec’s private aerial photograph collection was utilized to review historical aerial imagery of the Phase 
One Study Area. Aerial photographs taken in 1934, 1954, 1960, 1968, 1974, and 1988 were reviewed. In 
addition, online mapping from the Town of Oakville GIS was reviewed from 1995 to 2015 (not inclusive). 
Satellite images were also reviewed on Google Earth Software for the following years: 2017 and 2018. No 
additional aerial imagery was obtained as the time period between photos was deemed adequate. The 
aerial photograph from 1934 appeared to show the Phase One Property as vacant or agricultural land. 
The current building appeared on the Phase One Property in the 1954 and 1960 aerial photographs in its 
original configuration. Aerial photographs between 1968 and 2018 display the current configuration of the 
Phase One building and property.  
4.3.2 
Topography, Hydrology and Geology 
4.3.2.1 Topography and Regional Drainage 
The Phase One Property is generally flat with a drainage ditch observed to be located immediately west 
of the Phase One Property boundary along MacDonald Road.   
Based on information provided in the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s online Make a 
Topographic Map tool, and the observed topography near the Phase One Property, the regional surface 
drainage (inferred groundwater flow direction) appears to be to the southwest towards Sixteen Mile 
Creek, located approximately 145 m southwest of the Phase One Property.

It should also be noted that the elevation of the local groundwater table can generally mimic the local 
topography and may not reflect the regional trend in drainage. The local shallow groundwater flow pattern 
also can be influenced by subsurface structures in the vicinity, such as building foundations, weeping 
tiles, and utility trenches. 
4.3.2.2 Hydrology and Surface Water Drainage 
The exterior surface of the Phase One Property is primarily composed of asphalt parking areas and 
landscaped areas consisting of brick interlock, grass, and trees. Two catch basins were identified along 
the eastern property boundary. Stormwater is anticipated to drain either by infiltration or to catch basins.  
4.3.2.3 Surficial Geology 
Based on information obtained from Ontario Geological Survey Map 2556, titled Quaternary Geology of 
Ontario, southern sheet, native surficial soils near the Phase One Property reportedly consist of Halton 
Till, predominantly silt to silty clay, high in carbonate content and clast poor. The characteristic 
permeability of these soil deposits is low to medium. 
A previous investigation was completed by Maat Environmental Engineering Corporation in 2017. Stantec 
reviewed three borehole logs (BH1 to BH3) from this investigation. Boreholes BH1 and BH2 were 
advanced on the Phase One Property to a maximum depth of 3.9 m BGS and 4.0 m BGS, respectively. 
Borehole BH3 was advanced to a maximum depth of 5.6 m BGS, encountering bedrock at 5.2 m BGS.  
Subsurface conditions encountered in the boreholes consisted of gravel overlying fill materials (described 
as silty sand) to depths ranging from 0.5 to 4.6 m BGS. Native clayey silt till was present below the fill to 
depths ranging from 3.8 to 5.2 m BGS.  
A previous report completed by AiMS Environmental in 2013 investigated the subsurface conditions by 
advancing five boreholes to depths ranging from 3.8 m to 4.6 m BGS. A silty sand fill overburden was 
also noted during the UST removal completed in December 2012.  
4.3.2.4 Bedrock Geology 
Based on information obtained from Ontario Geological Survey Map 2544, titled Bedrock Geology of 
Ontario, Southern Sheet, bedrock in the area of the Phase One Property is reported to consist of shale, 
limestone, dolostone, and/or siltstone of the Queenston Formation. The depth to bedrock was not 
indicated on the map. 
Previous investigations completed at the Phase One Property identified bedrock as weathered shale, at 
5.2 m BGS (BH3). According to the Water Well Information System database entries reviewed in the 
ERIS report, shale was encountered at depths ranging from 4.5 m to 19.0 m BGS within the Phase One 
Study Area.

4.3.2.5 Fill Materials 
Based on a review of selected aerial photographs and topographic maps, no pits or quarries were 
identified at or near the Phase One Property. Previous investigations completed in various areas of the 
Phase One Property have identified limited fill materials, described as gravel and silty sand in some 
areas. Fill materials were previously imported to the Site to backfill the remedial excavation for the former 
UST. Chemical analysis results for this fill material were not available for review during the Phase One 
ESA. The presence of fill of an unknown environmental quality represents a PCA which has contributed to 
an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC-2).    
4.3.2.6 Water Bodies and Areas of Natural Significance 
No water bodies are present at the Phase One Property. Sixteen Mile Creek is located approximately 145 
m southwest of the Phase One Property and Lake Ontario is located approximately 1.3 kilometres 
southeast of the Phase One Property. Based on a review of selected aerial photographs and topographic 
maps, no other bodies of water or areas of natural significance were identified on or in the immediate 
vicinity of the Phase One Property.

Well Records 
Included in the ERIS report was a search of the Water Well Information System database for properties 
within the Phase One Study Area. Relevant details related to subsurface conditions encountered in 
wells/boreholes completed at or near the Phase One Property were provided in Section 4.2.15 and 
Section 4.3.2 above. 
Information included in the ERIS report indicated that no domestic potable water wells are located at the 
Phase One Property. The water well records for the Phase One Property are for observation wells. The 
water wells listed in the Phase One Study Area are not anticipated to be PCAs that would contribute to an 
APEC at the Phase One Property.  
4.4 
SITE OPERATING RECORDS 
As the Phase One Property is not deemed an Enhanced Investigation Property, as defined in 
O.Reg.153/04, no additional operating records were required or made available for review.

INTERVIEWS 
An interview was conducted at the Phase One Property at the time of the site reconnaissance. The 
interview was carried out with Mr. Keith Lihou, property manager of Transmetro, in order to obtain 
information to assist in determining if an APEC exists at the Phase One Property, as well as to identify 
details of current/former PCAs or potential contaminant pathways on, in or under the Phase One 
Property. Pertinent information gathered during this interview has been included in the applicable sections 
of this report. Stantec was accompanied by Mr. Lihou during the site reconnaissance.

SITE RECONNAISSANCE 
6.1 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 
A site reconnaissance was conducted at the Phase One Property by Mr. Aseel Kaiser of Stantec on 
December 23, 2019. The interview and site reconnaissance were completed between 12:30 pm and 4:30 
pm, and the weather was sunny with a temperature of approximately 7°C. The Phase One Property and 
readily visible and publicly accessible portions of nearby properties within the Phase One Study Area 
were observed for PCAs. 
Figures showing the Phase One Property and properties within the Phase One Study Area are included in 
Appendix B, while selected photographs of the Phase One Property are included in Appendix C. 
6.2 
SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS AT PHASE ONE PROPERTY 
6.2.1 
Property Information 
At the time of the site visit, the Phase One Property consisted of a vacant three-storey former medical 
office building, asphalt parking areas, and landscaped land consisting of brick interlock, grass, and trees.  
6.2.2 
Property Buildings and Structures 
The following table provides various construction details for the site building:

6.2.3 
Aboveground and Underground Storage Tanks 
No chemical or fuel above ground storage tanks (ASTs) or USTs were identified or reported to be present 
at the Phase One Property at the time of the site reconnaissance visit. Further, no vent or fill pipes 
indicating the potential presence of an abandoned or decommissioned UST were observed. However, as 
previously described in Section 4.1.5 above, a 4500 L (1,000-gallon) heating oil UST was removed from 
the Phase One Property in December 2012. The UST was observed to be in poor condition which 
resulted in leaked fuel oil and soil contamination in the area of the southeast corner of the building. 
170.31 tonnes of contaminated soils were removed from the Phase One Property in December 2012.

Further investigations in 2017 resulted in three additional soil samples with concentrations of PHCs 
meeting the applicable provincial standards. However, due to the poor integrity of the building foundation 
in the area of sampling, further sampling beneath the footing to confirm soil conditions was abandoned. 
The historical presence of a UST with previous contaminated soil and groundwater in the surrounding 
area represents a PCA which has contributed to an APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC-1).  
6.2.4 
Underground Utilities and Services 
Based on information provided by the site contact, all utility services at the Phase One Property have 
been terminated. Although, the Phase One Property is no longer serviced, the underground utilities 
remain on-site and include sanitary and storm sewers, potable water service, telecommunications lines, 
hydro-electrical lines, and natural gas.

At the time of the site reconnaissance the building was vacant.   
There is one hydraulic elevator located inside the south side of the building. The elevator was installed 
during a renovation completed in 1965 and was in use until the building closed in 2017. A hydraulic 
cylinder of unknown volume and age was observed during the site visit. The construction details for the 
elevator were not provided, and the elevator sump pits were not accessed during site reconnaissance. 
The site contact reported that there have been no issues reported by the elevator maintenance contractor 
and as such, the presence of a hydraulic elevator was not considered to be a PCA which would contribute 
to an APEC at the Phase One Property at this time.  
Some chemicals (paint, dry wall mud, and hydraulic oil) were stored in the basement of the building. 
Good housekeeping and spill containment measures were generally observed throughout the Site.

6.2.6 
Wells 
Six existing groundwater monitoring wells were observed to be present on the Phase One Property at the 
time of the site reconnaissance. The observed monitoring wells are identified on Figure No.3, Appendix 
B. No other existing or abandoned wells (potable water, oil, gas, or disposal) were observed or reported 
to be present on the Phase One Property at the time of the site reconnaissance.  
6.2.7 
Sewage Works 
The Phase One Property is connected to The Halton Region storm and sanitary sewer system, with two 
catch basins located on the Phase One Property. No septic systems were identified or reported on the 
Phase One Property at the time of the site reconnaissance.  
6.2.8 
Surface Features 
At the time of the site reconnaissance, the exterior surfaces of the Site consisted of asphalt-paved 
parking areas and landscaped areas consisting of brick interlock, grass, and trees. A ditch was identified 
immediately west of the Phase One Property running along MacDonald Road. No other watercourses, 
pits, lagoons, or ditches were identified on the Phase One Property and no standing water was observed. 
6.2.9 
Current or Former Railway Lines or Spurs 
No evidence of current or former railway lines or spurs were observed or reported to be present at the 
Phase One Property.  
6.2.10 Surface Staining and Stressed Vegetation 
No stained surficial materials or stressed vegetation that would represent a PCA that would be expected 
to contribute to an APEC at the Phase One Property were observed. 
6.2.11 Imported Fill and Debris 
Four stockpiles of what is assumed to be topsoil were observed north of the building. The site contact 
reported the topsoil to be from large planters. No further evidence of imported fill materials (e.g., berms) 
was observed at the Phase One Property at the time of the site reconnaissance. Minor amounts of wood 
and metal debris were present in the southern portion of the Site. No pits or quarries were identified at or 
near the Phase One Property based on a review of selected aerial photographs and topographic maps.  
Previous investigations completed in various areas of the Phase One Property have identified limited fill 
materials, described as gravel and silty sand in some areas. Fill materials were previously imported to the 
Site to backfill the remedial excavation for the former UST. Chemical analysis results for this fill material 
were not available for review during the Phase One ESA. The presence of fill of an unknown 
environmental quality represents a PCA which has contributed to an APEC at the Phase One Property 
(APEC-2).

6.2.12 Enhanced Investigation Property 
The Phase One Property is not considered an Enhanced Investigation Property, as defined in 
O.Reg.153/04. 
6.3 
PHASE ONE STUDY AREA 
The current activities observed on nearby properties at the time of the site reconnaissance and a 
summary of historical information gathered through the records review are presented below: 
6.3.1 
North 
The area north of the Phase One Property is Reynolds Street. North of Reynolds Street was observed to 
be under construction for the redevelopment of the Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital and recreational 
centre. Aerial photographs indicate that construction began between 2017 and 2018. The hospital 
property (327 Reynolds Street) was undeveloped land in the 1932 FIP. The property was first developed 
prior to 1954, as a building is displayed on the property in the 1954 aerial photograph. The 1965 city 
directory confirms the location of the Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital at this address. The 1967 FIP 
identified two 10,000-gallon oil USTs immediately northeast of the Phase One Property across Reynolds 
Street on the Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital property. The historical presence of USTs in the 
inferred upgradient direction of the Phase One Property represents a PCA that has contributed to an 
APEC at the Phase One Property (APEC-3).  
In addition, the Oakville–Trafalgar Memorial Hospital was listed on the National PCB Inventory database 
as well as the Ontario Inventory of PCB Storage Sites between 1991 and 2004. As PCBs are generally 
localized and do not migrate easily, the historical presence of PCB material and a PCB storage facility 
was considered a PCA not contributing to an APEC at the Phase One Property. The Oakville–Trafalgar 
Memorial Hospital was also listed as a waste generator of alkaline solutions, inorganic sludges, slurries, 
or solids, aliphatic solvents and residues, light fuels, PCBs, petroleum based waste oils and sludges, 
waste crankcase oils and lubricants, halogenated solvents, waste compressed gases, organic and 
inorganic laboratory chemicals, alkaline wastes, pathological wastes, paint/pigment/coating residues, acid 
waste, organic acids, aromatic solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The wastes generated are associated with 
the operation of a hospital and ambulatory health care services, however the areas of this property where 
wastes could be stored or processed is further east and away from the Phase One Property. Thus, the 
historical waste generation is not considered a PCA contributing to an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
291 Reynolds Street (northeast of the Phase One Property) was identified as the Halton Board of 
Education and was listed as a waste generator of inorganic and organic laboratory chemicals, aromatic 
solvents, petroleum distillates, oil skimmings and sludges, waste oils and lubricants. The nature of the 
waste generation appears to be associated with schools. Thus, the anticipated volume of waste 
generated is minimal and not considered to represent a PCA likely to contribute to an APEC at the Phase

One Property. The Halton Board of Education was listed at this address on the 1989,1984, and 1979 city 
directories.  
This property was identified as the Oakville Trafalgar High School in the 1967 FIP and the 1965 and 1975 
city directory listings. At the time of the site reconnaissance, the property use could not be identified as a 
construction wall surrounded the property.  
At the time of the site reconnaissance, the area north of the Phase One Property and west of MacDonald 
Road were observed to be residential properties. These locations were first developed prior to 1932, as 
the 1932 FIP depicts several buildings assumed to be for residential use in this area.  
6.3.2 
East 
The property immediately east of the Phase One Property was a residential home. At the time of the site 
reconnaissance, the areas east of that property appeared to be operating as MacLachlan College and 
residential properties beyond that. Aerial photographs indicated that the area east of the Phase One 
Property appeared to be vacant in the 1932 FIP but developed in the 1954 aerial photograph. Thus, the 
properties east of the Phase One Property, have operated as residential/community uses since first 
developed sometime between 1932 and 1954. This was confirmed by a city directory search. 337 
Trafalgar Road was identified as MacLachlan College between 1984 and 2000 and as single and multi-
residential between 1971 and 1984.  
Between 2005 and 2019, MacLachlan College was registered as a waste generator of organic and 
inorganic laboratory chemicals, waste compressed gases, paint/pigment/coating residues, and acid waste 
associated with schools and instruction. Thus, the anticipated volume of waste generated is minimal and 
not considered to represent a PCA likely to contribute to an APEC at the Phase One Property. In addition, 
a TSSA Historic Incident occurred at 344 Reynolds Street (20 m east/southeast of the Phase One 
Property) when an incident or near miss occurrence involving a gaseous fuel occurred. Release of a 
gaseous fuel is not considered a PCA contributing to an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
6.3.3 
South 
The areas south of the Site were observed to be residential at the time of the site reconnaissance. The 
area south of the Phase One Property appears to be developed as residential properties in the 1932 
aerial photograph. Further south of the Phase One Property is Trafalgar Road.  No PCAs considered to 
contribute to an APEC were identified south of the Phase One Property.  
6.3.4 
West 
West of the Phase One Property across MacDonald Road were residential properties at the time of the 
site reconnaissance. FIPs indicated that the areas west of the Phase One Property have been residential 
since at least 1932.

Two natural gas leaks reportedly occurred at 397 Trafalgar Road (155 m southwest of the Phase One 
Property) in 2016. Natural gas pipeline leaks result in methane being released to the atmosphere, which 
are not considered to represent a PCA contributing to an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
384 Reynolds Street (70 m northwest of the Phase One Property), was listed the manufactures database 
in 1986 for the manufacturing of wood household furniture, except upholster and glass products made of 
purchased glass. Due to the nature of manufacturing occurring at 384 Reynolds Street, it is not 
considered a PCA likely to contribute to an APEC at the Phase One Property. 
Two Union Gas Limited natural gas leaks occurred on at 271 MacDonald Road (20 m west of the Phase 
One Property) on June 26, 2018 and April 25, 2019. Both leaks were a result of an operational error. As 
the leaks were to the atmosphere, they are not considered a PCA contributing to an APEC at the Phase 
One Property.

WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF INVESTIGATION 
Section 4.0 presents the findings of the records review for the Phase One Property and Section 5.0 
presents the findings of the interviews with the site contacts.  Section 6.2 presents the findings of the site 
reconnaissance of the Phase One Property and the Phase One Study Area. No additional investigations 
were undertaken during the Phase One ESA to assess potential environmental concerns noted or 
identified during the site reconnaissance or records review. A summary of the relevant findings to the 
existence of APECs at the Phase One Property is provided below in Section 7.3.

Phase One Conceptual Site Model 
Physical Characteristics/Pathways 
Description 
Subsurface Soils  
Based on information obtained from Ontario Geological Survey Map 
2556, titled Quaternary Geology of Ontario, southern sheet, native 
surficial soils near the Phase One Property reportedly consist of Halton 
Till, predominantly silt to silty clay, high in carbonate content and clast 
poor. The characteristic permeability of these soil deposits is low to 
medium. 
A previous investigation was completed by Maat Environmental 
Engineering Corporation in 2017. Stantec reviewed three borehole logs 
(BH1 to BH3) from this investigation. Boreholes BH1 and BH2 were 
advanced on the Phase One Property to a maximum depth of 3.9 m BGS 
and 4.0 m BGS, respectively. Borehole BH3 was advanced to a 
maximum depth of 5.6 m BGS, encountering bedrock at 5.2 m BGS.  
Subsurface conditions encountered in the boreholes consisted of gravel 
overlying fill materials (described as silty sand) to depths ranging from 0.5 
to 4.6 m BGS. Native clayey silt till was present below the fill to depths 
ranging from 3.8 to 5.2 m BGS.  
A previous report completed by AiMs Environmental in 2013 investigated 
the subsurface conditions by advancing five boreholes to depths ranging 
from 3.8 m to 4.6 m BGS. A silty sand fill overburden was also noted 
during the UST removal completed in December 2012.  
Bedrock 
Based on information obtained from Ontario Geological Survey Map 
2544, titled Bedrock Geology of Ontario, Southern Sheet, bedrock in the 
area of the Phase One Property is reported to consist of shale, limestone, 
dolostone, and/or siltstone of the Queenston Formation. The depth to 
bedrock was not indicated on the map. 
Previous investigations completed at the Phase One Property identified 
bedrock as weathered shale, at 5.2 m BGS (BH3). According to the 
Water Well Information System database entries reviewed in the ERIS 
report, shale was encountered at depths ranging from 4.5 m to 19.0 m 
BGS within the Phase One Study Area.  
Inferred Ground Water Flow Direction 
Based on information provided in the Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry’s online Make a Topographic Map tool, and the 
observed topography near the Phase One Property, the regional surface 
drainage (inferred groundwater flow direction) appears to be to the 
south/southwest towards Sixteen Mile Creek, located approximately 145 
m southwest of the Phase One Property.  
Underground Utilities 
Based on information provided by the site contacts, underground utilities 
present at the Phase One Property include sanitary and storm sewers, 
potable water service, telecommunications lines, hydro-electrical lines, 
and natural gas. The exact locations of all underground utilities were not 
confirmed during the Phase One ESA. All underground utilities at the Site 
are no longer active. Permeable backfill materials in the immediate 
vicinity of these utilities can affect migration of contaminants of concern if 
present.

Discussion of Uncertainty or Absence of Information  
The past use of the Phase One Property is well understood based on historical information sources 
obtained and reviewed during the Phase One ESA.  The physical characteristics of the land area 
comprising the Site are inferred from records reviewed during the Phase One ESA.  Minor variability in 
subsurface stratigraphy within the Phase One Property can be expected however these variations would 
be taken into account by the APECs already identified in this report.  The presence of subsurface utilities 
in unconfirmed locations at the Site is not expected to contribute significant contaminant migration 
pathways within the Phase One Property. No other potential uncertainties or missing information were 
encountered during completion of the Phase One ESA.  
The figures provided in Appendix B include features and details in relation to the Phase One Study Area 
and the Phase One Property. In general, the drawings illustrate the following where applicable: road 
names and existing buildings and structures; water bodies; location of areas of natural significance; 
presence of drinking water wells at the Phase One Property (if present); property usage types on 
adjoining properties; PCAs; APECs; locations and types of known tanks; general direction of groundwater 
flow in the vicinity of the Phase One Property; and, the approximate locations of underground utilities or 
structures, if known.

CONCLUSIONS 
8.1 
WHETHER PHASE TWO ENVIRONMENTAL SITE ASSESSMENT BEFORE 
RECORD OF SITE CONDITION SUBMITTED 
Stantec recommends a Phase Two ESA be competed at the Site to evaluate the soil and groundwater 
quality in the vicinity of the above-mentioned APECs, prior to submitting a Record of Site Condition.  
8.2 
RECORD OF SITE CONDITION BASED ON PHASE ONE 
ENVIRONMENTAL SITE ASSESSMENT ALONE 
It is Stantec’s opinion that an RSC cannot be filed based on the findings of this Phase One ESA.

Underground Storage Tank Removal- 358 Reynolds Street, Oakville, Ontario
TSSA Services Request Number: 1104232
Dear Dr. Prince,
Thank you for submitting the report entitled "Environmental lnspection & Testinq Services. Oakville
Medical Afts Buildinq. 358 Revnolds Street, Oakviile. Ontario", prepared by AiMS Environmental (A|MS),
and dated March 2, 2013. This report has been submitted to the Technical Standards and Safety
Authority (TSSA) as required by TSSA lnspection Report (lnspection Report Number: 4432036 and
lnspection Service Request Number: 1081320) and associated Order. The Order was issued by TSSA
lnspector Terry Maher following the discovery of the removal of an underground storage tank (UST)
located at the above noted address.
The report informs Fuels Safety Program (FSP) of the removal of one (1) out-of-use 1,000 gallon steel
heating oil underground storage tank (UST) from the above noted address. FSP will update our files
accordingly to reflect the removal of the tank system.
The AiMS repod provides the following information:
. 
Upon initial site inspection, AiMS reports observation of one (1) vent pipe, suspected to be
associated with a former or existing heating oil UST, along the west wall of the on-site 3-storey
medical building.
Due to this discovery and prior to UST removal, in October 2012 A|MS supervised the
advancement of five (5) exterior boreholes, two (2) of which were completed as groundwater
monitoring wells.
AiMS selected the Ontario Ministry of the Environment's (MOE) (O. Reg 153104, as amended)
Table 3 Site Condition Standards (SCS) for residential/parkland/institutional property use in a
non-potable groundwater condition with medium to fine textured soils as being applicable for use
at this site.
Select soil and groundwater samples were collected and submitted for laboratory analysis of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes (BTEX),
petroleum hydrocarbon fractions F1 to F4 (PHC F1-F4), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
and heavy metals.
Laboratory analytical results for the soil and groundwater samples were reported by A|MS to be
within the selected MOE Table 3 SCS for all the parameters analyzed with the exception of one
(1) soilsample collected from BH5 which exceeded the SCS for PHC F1 to F3 and multíple PAH
parameters. ln addition, petroleum odours and an oily film/sheen were observed on the sudace of
a

purged groundwater from monitoring well MW4. The presence of liquid petroleum hydrocarbons
(LPH) is considered an exceedance of the MOE Table 3 SCS.
UST excavation activities were completed between December 12 and 13,2012. Prior to removal,
a total of 3,800 litres of residual fuel and liquid waste water was removed from the UST and
disposed of off-site.
Upon removal, AiMS notes surficial corrosion and small perforations of the steel tank. As a result,
some residual heating oil leaked from the tank and contacted the surrounding areas of the tank
cavity where apparent petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) impacted soils were observed.
Remedial activities were initiated at the site. A total of 171.05 tonnes of impacted soil around the
UST was transported and disposed of off-site. During the course of the excavation, a total of
3,250 litres of accumulated groundwater was removed from the excavation cavity for off-site
disposal.
Confirmatory soil samples from the final extents of excavation (floor and sidewalls) were collected
and submitted for laboratory analysis of PHC F1-F4 and PAHs.
Laboratory analytical results for the final confirmatory soil samples as reported by AIMS indicate
all soil concentrations were within the selected MOE Table 3 SCS. Any interim soil exceedances
were removed and subsequent confirmatory samples collected.
During excavation backfilling activities, AiMS supervised the installation of two (2) recovery wells
for future groundwater removal in the former tank area.
Upon completion of remedialexcavation activities, on December 19,2012 AiMS collected one (1)
groundwater sample from monitoring well MW4 and submitted the sample for laboratory analysis
of PHC F1 to F4 and PAHs. Laboratory analytical results indicate that the sample exceeded the
MOE Table 3 SCS for PHC F2.
On January 18, 2013 approximately 2,800 litres of groundwater was evacuated from the former
tank nest recovery wells and a subsequent groundwater sample was collected from MW4 and
submitted for laboratory analysis of PHC F1 to F4. Groundwater concentrations continued to
exceed the SCS for PHC F2.
After an additional 4,000 litres of groundwater was removed from the recovery well between
February 21 and 22,2013 a final groundwater sample was collected from MW4 and submitted for
laboratory analysis of PHC F1 to F4. All groundwater concentrations were within the MOE Table
3 SCS.
A|MS concludes that no fuñher actions are warranted at the site with the exception of quarterly
purging, sampling and analysis of groundwater from the on-site monitoring well MW4.

AiMS Environmental previously commenced a Phase i ESA of the subject property in
September 2012. One vent pipe, suspected to be associated with a former or existing
heating oil UST, was observed entering the ground surface along the west wall. No
documentation regarding the removal of the UST was available for review.
AiMS Environmental subsequently commenced a Phase II ESA of the subject property
in October, 2A12, which entailed the drilling oÍ a total of five exterior boreholes to
depths ranging between 3.8 to 4.6 m below the existing grade at strategically selected
and accessible locations on the subject property. Groundwater monitoring wells were
also installed in two selected boreholes, as showninDrøwing 3.
Representative "worse-case" soil samples were analyzed for PHCs, poiycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at an
independent accredited laboratory. In comparison with the 2011 Ontario Soil, Ground
Wøter, and Sediment Stntzdards for Use Under Part XV.1of the Environmental Protection
Act (EPA) fine-textured soil criteria, the results of laboratory analyses on all eight soil
samples and one groundwater sample indicated that the measured contaminant
concentrations generally complied with the applicable Table 3 standards for possible
future residential land uses, with the exception of one soil sample from Borehole 5
(BHs), which had exceedences for PHC fractions Fr to Fs and multiple PAH parameters.
In addition, petroleum odours and an oily film/sheen were observed on the surface of
purged groundwater from Monitoring Well4 (MW4).
EXCAVATIONS, VETTIFICATION S OIL SAMI'LIN G AIVD AhTALYSIS
The steel UST and subsequent excavation cavity was located outside of the west wall of
the 3-storey medicai building. Reportedly, the L,000-ga11on heating oil UST had been
out-of-service for some time.
The UST was removed pursuant to tlne Technicøl Standørds ønd Søfety Authority (TSSA)
document entitled EnaironmentøI Mønøgement Protocol for Fuel Høndling Sites in Ontørio
(revised August zA12). This document applies to operations governed by the Technical
Standards and Safety Act and associated Ontario Regulations (O. Reg. 213101 and
2L7101) and the Liquid Fuels Hsndling Code and Fuel OiI Code.
The excavation of the UST was performed between December 12 to 13, 2012 by VAL
Entsironmentøl Inc., a licensed contractor and holder of TSSA Registration Number
A076560747. Utility lines were cleared and work permits were obtatned by VAL
Enaironmentøl Inc. prior to the commencement of work.

number of samples taken from the excavation walls and floor were in conformance or in
excess of the minimum specified in accordance with MOE Ontørio Reguløtion 511109
under the EPA "lVlinimum Confirmation Sampling Requirements for Excavation"
(December 2009). The samples were subjected to headspace screening using the
portable OVÀ4. Since the floor area of the UST cavity was between 25 and 50 m2, live
"worst-case" soil samples (three from the sidewalls and two from the floor) were
selected and submitted to Maxxøm AnøIytics htc., an accredited environmental
Iaboratory, for the analyses of PHCs by fractionation (Fr to Fa) ancl PAHs.
Based on the residential and commercial use of the area, its hydrogeology and the fact
that the groundwater is not used for drinking purposes, the appropriate site cleanup
standards were determined to be the 2011. Ontario Soil, Ground Wøter ønd Sediment
Støndards for Use Under Pørt XV.L of the EPA Table 3 fine-texfured soil criteria for
proposed residential land use in a non-potable groundwater situation. The selection of
the applicable MOE site assessment standards is schematically present ed in Figttre 1.
The results of the analyses are reported on tlne Løborøtory Certificøtes of Anølyses in
Appendix C. These results indicate that the contaminant concentrations in the soil
samples analyzed generally complied with the 2011, provincial standards, with the
exceptions of one sidewall sample (52-3, approximately 3 m below grade). The
concentration of PHC fraction Fz exceeded the EPA criterion.
Additional excavation was performed on December 18, 201,2, thus widening the cavity.
During this period, a total of 0.74 tonnes of contaminated soils were removed for off-site
disposal and one additional sidewall sample (S2-3X) was collected and submitted for
PHC analyses. Thereafter, the results of the analyses revealed that the measured
contaminant concentrations in all soil samples (including S2-3X) complied with the
current EPA Table 3 criteria.
During the course of the excavatiorç groundwater accumulated in the cavity and an
additional 3,250 L of liquid was evacuated from the cavity. A copy of the iiquid waste
shipping document is also reproducedin Appendix B. During backfilling of the cavity,
two recovery wells were installed for future groundwater evacuation at the locations
shown inDrørning 4.
Imported crushed limestone from Løførge Cntctdø in Stouffville, Ontario and sand fill
from Mexco Excøaøtion were used to backfill the cavity. A composite sample of the sand
fill was collected and submitted for heavy metals analyses, which complied with the
EPA Table 1 Background criteria. The Laborøtory Certificøte of Analysis is also presented
tn Appendix C.

Have the alarm system reviewed to meet the standards listed 
below.  The existing burglar alarm system may be inadequate to 
protect the property stored in your premises.  Due to the nature of 
the product and the value it is recommended that the system 
should meet the following standards:
•    ULC Certified Monitoring Station alarm system
•    Level 3 Extent of Protection 
•    Level III Line Security (DVACS Technology)
A fire extinguisher should be provided in the unit.
Portable fire extinguishers are recommended for the protection of 
both the building structure and the occupancy hazards contained 
therein.  The extinguishers can provide fire fighting assistance 
reducing the potential for a total loss or injury.  Provide a fire 
extinguisher in the unit ensuring that it is properly mounted and 
serviced before installation, a record of service is should be 
attached.  Extinguishers should be serviced on an annual basis by 
a qualified personnel.

Mineral Occurrences:
Provincial
rr-MNR-bb
In the early 70's, the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines created an inventory of approximately 19,000 mineral occurrences in Ontario, in 
regard to metallic and industrial minerals, as well as some information on building stones and aggregate deposits.  Please note that the "Horizontal 
Positional Accuracy" is approximately +/- 200 m.  Many reference elements for each record were derived from field sketches using pace or chain/tape 
measurements against claim posts or topographic features in the area.  The primary limiting factor for the level of positional accuracy is the scale of the 
source material. The testing of horizontal accuracy of the source materials was accomplished by comparing the plan metric (X and Y) coordinates of that
point with the coordinates of the same point as defined from a source of higher accuracy.

National Environmental Emergencies System (NEES):
Federal
rr-NEES-bb
In 2000, the Emergencies program implemented NEES, a reporting system for spills of hazardous substances.  For the most part, this system only 
captured data from the Atlantic Provinces, some from Quebec and Ontario and a portion from British Columbia. Data for Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and the Territories was not captured. However, NEES is also a repository for previous Environment Canada spill datasets.  NEES is 
composed of the historic datasets ' or Trends ' which dates from approximately 1974 to present. NEES Trends is a compilation of historic databases, 
which were merged and includes data from NATES (National Analysis of Trends in Emergencies System), ARTS (Atlantic Regional Trends System), 
and NEES.  In 2001, the Emergencies Program determined that variations in reporting regimes and requirements between federal and provincial 
agencies made national spill reporting and trend analysis difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the department has focused efforts on capturing data 
on spills of substances which fall under its legislative authority only (CEPA and FA). As such, the NEES database will be decommissioned in December 
2004.

Database Descriptions: This section provides a detailed explanation for each database including: source, information available, time coverage, and
acronyms used. They are listed in alphabetic order.
Detail Report: This is the section of the report which provides the most detail for each individual record. Records are summarized by location, starting
with the project property followed by records in closest proximity.
Distance: The distance value is the distance between plotted points, not necessarily the distance between the sites' boundaries. All values are an
approximation.
Direction:  The direction value is the compass direction of the site in respect to the project property and/or center point of the report.
Elevation: The elevation value is taken from the location at which the records for the site address have been plotted. All values are an approximation.
Source: Google Elevation API.
Executive Summary: This portion of the report is divided into 3 sections:
'Report Summary'- Displays a chart indicating how many records fall on the project property and, within the report search radii.
'Site Report Summary'-Project Property'- This section lists all the records which fall on the project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report'
section.
'Site Report Summary-Surrounding Properties'- This section summarizes all records on adjacent properties, listing them in order of proximity from the
project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report' section.
Map Key: The map key number is assigned according to closest proximity from the project property. Map Key numbers always start at #1. The project
property will always have a map key of '1' if records are available. If there is a number in brackets beside the main number, this will indicate the number
of records on that specific property. If there is no number in brackets, there is only one record for that property.
The symbol and colour used indicates 'elevation': the red inverted triangle will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Lower Elevation', the yellow triangle will dictate
'ERIS Sites with Higher Elevation' and the orange square will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Same Elevation.'
Unplottables: These are records that could not be mapped due to various reasons, including limited geographic information. These records may or
may not be in your study area, and are included as reference.
