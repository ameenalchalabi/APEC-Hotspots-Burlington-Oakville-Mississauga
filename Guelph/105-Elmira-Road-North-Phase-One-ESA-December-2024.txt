EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
CHUNG & VANDER DOELEN ENGINEERING LTD. (CVD) was retained by Mr. Wesley Hordyk of HIP 
Developments to conduct a Phase One Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the property located at 
105 Elmira Road North in Guelph, Ontario (hereinafter referred to as the “Phase One Property” and/or 
“Site”).  
 
The purpose of the Phase I ESA is to evaluate the environmental conditions of the Site and adjacent 
properties and to identify actual or potential sources of contamination associated with the subject 
property and surrounding properties. The Phase One ESA is part of the due diligence requirements for 
the Site, and it is understood that a Record of Site Condition (RSC) is not intended for the property at 
this time.  
 
The Phase One Property is a rectangular-shaped vacant property, approximately 2.49 acres in area, that 
is located on the northeast corner of Willow Road and Elmira Road North in an area of predominantly 
residential land uses.  
 
The Phase One Property was historically forested land until the late 1990s when the forest was cleared. 
The Phase One Property has remained vacant grassed land since the early 2000s.  
 
The findings of the Phase One ESA did not identify any actual or potential sources of contamination on 
the Site or surrounding properties.  It is CVD’s professional opinion that the potential for environmental 
liabilities associated with the Site under investigation is low, and that no further investigations are 
required at this time. This opinion is based on the following:  
 
• 
The Site does not appear to have ever been used for any land use that may produce, store, or 
dispose of environmentally hazardous materials.  
 
• 
The surrounding properties are not expected to pose an environmental concern for the Site. 
Past activities on the surrounding properties in these areas are not expected to pose an 
environmental concern for the Site.

A Phase One Environmental Site Assessment is a thorough review of all activities that may have 
impacted the Site from an environmental standpoint.  
 
CVD conducted this Phase One Environmental Site Assessment in general accordance with the amended 
Ontario Regulation 153/04. This report also conforms to Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Z768-01 
(R2022).  The above-noted procedures set standards for review of information pertaining to the Site, 
development of detailed checklists or protocols, conducting the Site inspection, and preparation of the 
final report. 
 
The scope of work for the Phase One ESA consisted of the following tasks: 
   
• 
Site reconnaissance on December 5, 2024;  
 
• 
Interview discussions with the Site representative throughout the Phase One ESA process; 
 
• 
Review the current use of the Site and the practices that may have impacted the environmental 
condition of the Site; 
 
• 
A review of available city directories, fire insurance plans (FIPs) and historical maps to determine 
previous occupants of the Site and surrounding properties and to determine the first developed 
use of the Site; 
 
• 
A search of available databases to identify actual or potential sources of contamination 
associated with the Site and surrounding properties; 
 
• 
Review of the previous environmental reports conducted for the property, if available; 
 
• 
Interpretation of available aerial photographs; 
 
• 
Contact government agencies to request information for the Site, regarding environmental 
regulatory registration or non-compliance.  Review any such information where available; 
 
• 
Interpretation of available topographic maps; 
 
• 
Prepare this report with conclusions based on the information obtained during this assessment. 
 
CVD relies on information received from all parties as accurate, unless contradicted by field observations 
or written documentation.

RECORDS REVIEW 
 
4.1 
General 
    
Available information sources, including regulatory databases were assessed in an effort to gain 
information related to past Site activities, and to address potential environmental issues that may be 
present at, or in the vicinity of the Site.  
 
4.1.1    Phase One Study Area Determination 
 
A preliminary review of the documents listed in Section 4.0 indicates that there are no obvious concerns 
with any properties outside a 250 m radius of the Site. The study area for the Phase One ESA is therefore 
determined to be within a 250 m radius of the Site.  
 
4.1.2     First Development Use Determination  
 
The Phase One Property is currently vacant land. The Phase One Property was historically forested land 
prior to the late 1990s when the forest was cleared.  
 
4.1.3     Fire Insurance Plans 
 
The Canadian Fire Insurance Plans (FIPs) in Ontario Collection, 1876 to 1973 (Vol. 5) was referenced for 
information regarding the Site and surrounding properties.  
 
No coverage for the Site was identified.  
 
4.1.4     Previous Environmental Reports 
 
No previous environmental reports for the Site were available to CVD during the completion of the 
Phase One ESA. 
 
4.2 
Environmental Source Information  
 
A summary of information obtained from available resource documents and from regulatory agency 
databases is provided as follows. A copy of all correspondence is included in Appendix E. 
 
Inventory of Coal Gasification Plant Waste Sites in Ontario

Inventory of Industrial Sites Producing or Using Coal Tar and Related Tars in Ontario 
 
A review of the Intera Technologies Ltd. Inventory of Industrial Sites Producing Coal Tars and Related 
Tars in Ontario (July 1988) revealed that the production and use of coal or other tars has not taken place 
at the Site or surrounding properties within 250 m. 
 
Ministry of the Environment Conservation and Parks Inventory of PCB Storage Sites in Ontario 
 
The 1998 Ontario Ministry of the Environment Inventory of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Storage Sites 
in Ontario indicated that there are no PCB storage Sites located within the Phase One Study Area.  
 
Ministry of the Environment Conservation and Parks (MECP) 
 
A FOI request was submitted to the MECP for information regarding any environmental concerns, 
orders, spills, investigations/prosecutions, Waste Generator Numbers/Classes and Certificates of 
Approval related to the Site. However, it can take several weeks to receive a response from the MECP.   
 
At the time of writing this report, we have not yet received a response to this request.  Any relevant 
information received from the MECP will be forwarded as an addendum to this report.   
 
The FOI request is included in Appendix E. 
 
Waste Disposal Site Inventory – Ontario MECP (1991) 
 
The Site is not listed in the MECP’s Waste Disposal Inventory. In addition, there are no active or closed 
landfill sites located within 250 m of the Site.  
 
The Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA), Fuels Safety Division (FSD)  
 
A Customer Service Advisor at TSSA was contacted to determine if any aboveground or underground 
storage tanks (ASTs or USTs) were listed in its database for the Site. A representative of the TSSA 
indicated that there are no registered fuel tanks on the property.  
 
A copy of the TSSA correspondence is included in Appendix E.

ERIS Report 
 
A request was made to Environmental Risk Information Services (ERIS) for a standard select report. The 
standard select report provides historical environmental information for the subject property and lands 
surrounding the Site within a 250 m radius. Selected federal, provincial and private sector databases are 
researched to identify potential environmental concerns. The standard select report is used to aid in the 
identification of possible environmental risk factors for commercial, industrial and residential sites.   
 
The following is a list of the database searches completed by ERIS for this assignment.  
 
• 
Commercial Fuel Oil Tanks (CFOT) 
• 
Fuel Storage Tank (FST) 
• 
Fuel Storage Tank – Historic (FSTH) 
• 
Ontario Regulation 347 Waste Generator Summary (GEN) 
• 
Private and Retail Fuel Storage Tanks (PRT) 
• 
Retail Fuel Storage Tanks (RST) 
• 
Scott’s Manufacturing Directory (SCT) 
• 
Ontario Spills (SPL) 
 
The standard select report, dated November 20, 2024, provided zero (0) listings for the Site and thirteen 
(13) listings for properties within a 250 m radius. The listings are evaluated in section 7.2 of this report. 
A review of the listings indicated no environmental concern to the Site.  
 
A copy of the ERIS report is included in Appendix F.

Year 
Observations 
1966 
No discernible changes are observed at the Site or surrounding properties. 
1972 
No discernible changes are observed at the Site.  
Grading is observed to the northeast and southeast of the Site within the Phase I study area.  
1990 
No discernible changes are observed at the Site.  
Grading continues to the northeast and southeast of the Site within the Phase I study area.  
2000 
The trees are removed, and grading is observed throughout the Site.  
Single-family residential buildings and associated road infrastructure are constructed to the 
north and east of the Site.  
2006 
Two (2) storage trailers are observed on the west corner of the Site. The Site is observed to be 
vacant grass-covered land.  
Willow Road and Elmira Road North are constructed adjacent to the south and west property 
boundaries of the Site, respectively. Residential development and associated road 
infrastructure are constructed to the west of the Site beyond Elmira Road North.   
2010 
The storage trailers are removed from the Site.  
Grading is observed on the property adjacent to the south of the Site beyond Willow Road.  
2024 
No discernible changes are observed at the Site.  
Residential development is observed on the property adjacent to the south of the Site beyond 
Willow Road.  
 
4.3.2 
Topography, Hydrology, Geology 
 
The Atlas of Canada Toporama interactive and the Grand River Conservation Authority Web-Map were 
accessed to retrieve spatial data relevant to the Site. Map contours reveal geodetic elevations of the Site 
to be at approximately 322.5-324 m.a.s.l. (metres above sea-level).  
 
The local topography gradually slopes down in a southeasterly direction. The localized shallow 
groundwater flow is inferred to follow the local topography and flow in a southeasterly direction 
towards a stream located approximately 360 m southeast of the Site.  
 
According to the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) Map 2153, “Quaternary 
Geology, Guelph Area”, the Site is located on surficial geology that consists of the Wisconsinan 
lacustrine, kame, and outwash sand deposit. This surficial geology shapes part of the spillways of the 
Guelph Drumlin Field physiographic region, as indicated in the GIS-based MNDM Map MRD228, 
“Physiography of Southern Ontario”.  
 
According to the MNDM Map 2544, “Bedrock Geology of Ontario, Southern Sheet”, the bedrock in the 
area generally consists of dolostone of the Guelph Formation.

4.3.3 
Fill Materials 
 
Fill material composition and source location are considerations in determining whether environmental 
concerns are present. Importation of fill of unknown quality is identified as a potential contaminating 
activity within Ontario Regulation 153/04.  
 
Based on observations made during the recent Site reconnaissance and a review of the aerial 
photographs for the Site, there are no obvious signs of soil removal or fill importation to the Site and 
therefore CVD does not anticipate deleterious fill material to be present on the Site.  
 
4.3.4 
Water Bodies and Areas of Natural Significance 
 
There are no bodies of water located in close proximity (250 m) to the Site. The nearest body of water is 
a stream located approximately 360 m southeast of the Site. A forested wetland area (Ellis Creek 
Wetland Trail) is located to the west of the Site beyond Elmira Road North.  
 
The Grand River Source Protection Plan designates Wellhead Protection Areas (WHPAs) around each 
municipal drinking-water supply well. The vulnerability of WHPAs is measured on a 10-point scale and 
indicates how quickly water (and contaminants) move from the surface to the aquifer.  
 
The Site is located within the WHPA-B which delineates areas found within the two (2) year time of 
travel to a municipal drinking-water supply well. The Site is located within a WHPA Vulnerability area 
with a score of ten (10) which indicates high vulnerability.  
 
4.3.5 
Well Records 
 
A review of the MECP well record data revealed no well records within the Phase One Study Area.  
 
4.4 
Site Operating Records 
 
The Phase One ESA property did not have any Site operation records for review during the Phase One 
ESA.

SITE RECONNAISSANCE 
 
6.1 
General Requirements 
 
A visual survey of the Phase One Property was completed by Ms. Jordyn Atkins of CVD on December 5, 
2024. The qualifications of the assessor are provided in Appendix G.  
 
Photographs documenting the Phase One Property and surrounding properties taken on the day of the 
Site reconnaissance, along with written descriptions can be found in Appendix D.  
 
6.2 
Specific Observations at Phase One Property 
 
The Phase One Property is currently vacant grassed land. The Site is bound to the north and east by 
single-family residential dwellings and wooden fences. The Site is bound to the south and west by 
sidewalks and Willow Road and Elmira Road North, respectively. Some yard waste and debris were 
observed on the southeast corner of the Site. The Phase One Property is generally graded evenly with 
the surrounding properties.  
 
Rail Spurs 
 
No indication of a rail spur was noted on the Site or surrounding properties.  
 
Water Sources 
 
The Phase One Property is currently vacant land, therefore no water source infrastructure is present.  
 
Staining 
 
No surface staining was observed on the Phase One Property.  
 
Vegetation  
 
No stressed vegetation was observed at the Phase One Property.  
 
Underground and Aboveground Storage Tanks 
 
Site inspections and interviews were conducted to assess the presence/absence and condition (if 
present) of underground storage tanks (USTs) and aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) at the Site.  
 
The Phase One Property is currently vacant land and historically been forested land. CVD did not find 
any correspondence to support the historical presence of USTs/ASTs at the Site and did not observe any 
evidence of historical USTs or ASTs during the recent Site reconnaissance.

The Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) were also requested to review their computer 
database for the Site with regard to registered USTs and ASTs containing petroleum products. The TSSA 
reported that there are no records for fuel storage at the Site.  
 
A copy of the TSSA correspondence is included in Appendix E.  
 
Chemical Inventory, Storage and Handling 
 
No chemicals were observed during the Site visit. Based on reported history at the Site, it is unlikely that 
historical use, storage, or disposal of potentially hazardous chemicals has occurred at the Site.  
 
Solid and Liquid Waste Generation and Disposal 
 
Based on the reported history of the Site, no solid or liquid wastes are currently generated or stored on 
the Phase One Property.  
 
Designated Substances 
 
In Ontario, the Occupational Health and Safety Act has a list of nearly a dozen substances have been 
classified as "designated substances" largely in response to their harmful characteristics.  
 
Asbestos Containing Materials 
 
Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring minerals, formerly used for thermal and acoustic insulation, as 
well as fireproofing. The use of asbestos was common due to its strength and resistance to heat, and is 
often found in old ceiling tiles, pipe and vessel insulation, blown into structural beams and ceilings, in 
floor tile, linoleum, and mastic. The use of asbestos building materials was banned in Canada in the late 
1970's.  
 
Asbestos is not always an immediate hazard, though when asbestos containing materials are disturbed, 
microscopic fibres become airborne and may be inhaled by humans, where it may cause cancer and lung 
disease. 
 
The Phase One Property is currently vacant land, therefore no ACMs are expected to be present.  
 
Lead Based Paint 
 
Lead is a highly toxic metal which, when present in the human body (in sufficient quantities), attacks the 
central nervous system and can result in numerous health problems.  Lead-based paints have not been 
used since the late 1970's, when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
banned it for use in all homes and most other buildings. 
 
The Phase One Property is currently vacant land, therefore no lead-based paints are expected to be 
present.

6.2.1 
Enhanced Investigation Property 
 
There are no current or historical processing or manufacturing activities related to the Phase One 
Property. Based on current and historical land uses on the Phase One Property, in accordance with the 
amended Ontario Regulation 153/04, subsection 13 (3), the Phase One Property is not considered to be 
an enhanced investigation property as it is currently not being used for one of the uses described in 
clause 32 (1) (b) of the regulation. 
 
6.2.2 
Written Description of Investigation 
 
Investigation of the Phase One Property and Phase One Study Area was conducted through a Site 
reconnaissance as described in section 6.1. Section 6.2 presents the findings of the Site reconnaissance. 
Observations of the Phase One Study Area made during the Site reconnaissance are presented in Section 
6.3. The physical setting of the Phase One Study Area, including water bodies and areas of natural 
significance, is discussed in Section 4.3. 
 
6.3 
Surrounding Properties Phase One Study Area 
 
Land uses currently and historically surrounding the Phase One Property are described as follows: 
 
North of the Site:

REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 
 
7.1 
Current and Past Uses 
 
The Phase One Property was historically a treed property prior to the late 1990s when the forest was 
cleared. The Site has been in its current state as a vacant grassed land since the early 2000s.  
 
7.2 
Potentially Contaminating Activities (PCAs) 
 
Potentially Contaminating Activities (PCAs) are uses or activities set out in Column A of Table 2 of 
Schedule D within Ontario Regulation 153/04 that are occurring or have occurred in the Phase One 
Study Area.  
 
No PCAs were identified on the Site or surrounding properties within the Phase One Study Area.  
 
7.3 
Areas of Potential Environmental Concern (APECs) 
 
Areas of potential environmental concern (APECs) are defined within the amended Ontario Regulation 
153/04 (amended regulation) as those on, in or under a phase one property where one or more 
contaminants are potentially present. APECs are related to PCAs set out and numbered in Column A of 
Table 2 of Schedule D in the amended regulation.  
 
There were no APECs identified on the Site.  
 
7.3.1 
Uncertainties 
 
Records Review 
 
Aerial photographs provide a view of potentially-contaminating land uses or features historically present 
on the Site.  There are uncertainties related to the use of the aerial photographs provided in historical 
reports as the quality of some aerial photographs did not allow some features to be clearly identified.  
Professional judgment was used to relate the historical features identified in the aerial photographs to 
present day locations.

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of the records obtained from the ERIS report are 
provided to reduce the uncertainty about the location of the database report.  The accuracy of the 
individual UTMs provided by ERIS cannot be verified.  When possible, the listed address was used to 
assist in determining the correct location.   
 
Municipal addresses are known to change and historical addresses may not necessarily have been in the 
same location as a property today with the same address.  Best judgment was used to link historical 
municipal addresses from the city directory to areas within the Phase One Study Area, however, the 
accuracy of all addresses has not been confirmed.   Maps and information provided in historical reports, 
as well as aerial photographs, were used in an effort to verify the current-day location of historical 
addresses.  
 
Interviews 
 
The individual(s) interviewed as part of the Phase One ESA were selected based on their knowledge of 
the current and/or past activities at the Site, and their availability.  There is uncertainty related to the 
information provided by these individuals, as some information could be based on hearsay or personal 
opinion.  Professional judgment was employed and information provided in the interviews was 
evaluated and/or confirmed using other sources (for example, historical reports) wherever possible.   
Previous information included in historical reports was used as appropriate and available. 
 
Site Reconnaissance 
 
There is little uncertainty related to the Site reconnaissance, as the observations were made directly by 
CVD.  Photographs and detailed notes were taken during the Site reconnaissance to document the 
current conditions of the Site and Phase One Study Area.  The records review was completed before the 
Site reconnaissance to allow any identified uncertainties related to the historical information to be 
verified in the field (where possible).

CONCLUSIONS 
 
CVD was retained to conduct a Phase One ESA on the property located 105 Elmira Road North in Guelph, 
Ontario. The purpose of the Phase One ESA is to evaluate the environmental conditions of the Site and 
adjacent properties and to identify any actual or potential sources of contamination associated with the 
Site and surrounding properties.  
 
The findings of the Phase One ESA did not identify any actual or potential sources of contamination on 
the Site or surrounding properties.  It is CVD’s professional opinion that the potential for environmental 
liabilities associated with the Site under investigation is low, and that no further investigations are 
required at this time. This opinion is based on the following:  
 
• 
The Site does not appear to have ever been used for any land use that may produce, store, or 
dispose of environmentally hazardous materials.  
 
• 
The surrounding properties are not expected to pose an environmental concern for the Site. 
Past activities on the surrounding properties in these areas are not expected to pose an 
environmental concern for the Site.

STUDY LIMITATIONS 
 
CVD has prepared this report for the exclusive use of HIP Developments in evaluating the environmental 
conditions of the Site at the time of CVD’s Site visit.  CVD will not be responsible for the use of this 
report by any third party, or reliance on or any decision to be made based on it without the prior written 
consent of CVD.  CVD accepts no responsibility for damages, if any, by any third party as a result of 
decisions or actions based on this report.  
 
This report presents an overview of issues of environmental concern, reflecting CVD’s best judgment 
using information reasonably available at the Site at the time of CVD’s Site visit.  CVD has prepared this 
report using information understood to be factual and correct and shall not be responsible for 
conditions arising from information or facts that were concealed or not fully disclosed to CVD at the 
time of the Site visit. 
 
The report identified the environmental conditions of the property at the time of the investigation, 
pursuant to a scope agreed to by our client. The report is not intended to be exhaustive in scope or to 
imply a risk-free property and that any parties relying on the report should consider their own 
environmental evaluation of the property, which could include an intrusive evaluation of the soil and 
groundwater on the property. 
 
Performance of a standardized Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in accordance with Canadian 
Standards Association (CSA) Z768-01 (2022) is intended to reduce, but not eliminate, uncertainty 
regarding the potential for recognized environmental conditions in connection with the property, given 
reasonable limits of time and cost.  This assessment was carried out using historical data and a Site 
walkover.  Intrusive testing is not part of the scope of this assessment. 
 
We trust that the above report is complete within our terms of reference.  If there are any questions 
concerning this matter, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

Environmental Risk Information Services (ERIS) can search the following databases. The extent of historical information varies with 
each database and current information is determined by what is publicly available to ERIS at the time of update. Note: Databases 
denoted with " * " indicates that the database will no longer be updated. See the individual database description for more information.
Abandoned Aggregate Inventory:
Provincial
rr-AAGR-bb
The MAAP Program maintains a database of abandoned pits and quarries.  Please note that the database is only referenced by lot and concession and 
city/town location.  The database provides information regarding the location, type, size, land use, status and general comments.*
Government Publication Date: Sept 2002* 
Aggregate Inventory:
Provincial
rr-AGR-bb
This database of licensed and permitted pits and quarries is maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), as regulated
under the Aggregate Resources Act, R.S.O. 1990. Aggregate site data has been divided into active and inactive sites. Active sites may be further 
subdivided into partial surrenders. In partial surrenders, defined areas of a site are inactive while the rest of the site remains active.
Government Publication Date: Up to Nov 2023 
Abandoned Mine Information System:
Provincial
rr-AMIS-bb
The Abandoned Mines Information System contains data on known abandoned and inactive mines located on both Crown and privately held lands.  The
information was provided by the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM), with the following disclaimer: "the database provided has been 
compiled from various sources, and the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines makes no representation and takes no responsibility that such 
information is accurate, current or complete".  Reported information includes official mine name, status, background information, mine start/end date, 
primary commodity, mine features, hazards and remediation.
Government Publication Date: 1800-Apr 2024 
Anderson's Waste Disposal Sites:
Private
rr-ANDR-bb
The information provided in this database was collected by examining various historical documents which aimed to characterize the likely position of 
former waste disposal sites from 1860 to present. The research initiative behind the creation of this database was to identify those sites that are missing 
from the Ontario MOE Waste Disposal Site Inventory, as well as to provide revisions and corrections to the positions and descriptions of sites currently 
listed in the MOE inventory.  In addition to historic waste disposal facilities, the database also identifies certain auto wreckers and scrap yards that have 
been extrapolated from documentary sources.  Please note that the data is not warranted to be complete, exhaustive or authoritative. The information 
was collected for research purposes only.
Government Publication Date: 1860s-Present 
Aboveground Storage Tanks:
Provincial
rr-AST-bb
Historical listing of aboveground storage tanks made available by the Department of Natural Resources and Forestry. Includes tanks used to hold water 
or petroleum. This dataset has been retired as of September 25, 2014 and will no longer be updated.
Government Publication Date: May 31, 2014 
Automobile Wrecking & Supplies:

rr-AUWR-bb
This database provides an inventory of known locations that are involved in the scrap metal, automobile wrecking/recycling, and automobile parts & 
supplies industry. Information is provided on the company name, location and business type.
Government Publication Date: 1999-Apr 30, 2024 
Borehole:
Provincial
rr-BORE-bb
A borehole is the generalized term for any narrow shaft drilled in the ground, either vertically or horizontally.  The information here includes geotechnical 
investigations or environmental site assessments, mineral exploration, or as a pilot hole for installing piers or underground utilities.  Information is from 
many sources such as the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) boreholes from engineering reports and projects from the 1950 to 1990's in Southern 
Ontario.  Boreholes from the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) including The Urban Geology Analysis Information System (UGAIS) and the York Peel 
Durham Toronto (YPDT) database of the Conservation Authority Moraine Coalition.  This database will include fields such as location, stratigraphy, 
depth, elevation, year drilled, etc. For all water well data or oil and gas well data for Ontario please refer to WWIS and OOGW.

Certificates of Approval:
Provincial
rr-CA-bb
This database contains the following types of approvals: Air & Noise, Industrial Sewage, Municipal & Private Sewage, Waste Management Systems and
Renewable Energy Approvals. The MOE in Ontario states that any facility that releases emissions to the atmosphere, discharges contaminants to 
ground or surface water, provides potable water supplies, or stores, transports or disposes of waste, must have a Certificate of Approval before it can 
operate lawfully. Fields include approval number, business name, address, approval date, approval type and status.  This database will no longer be 
updated, as CofA's have been replaced by either Environmental Activity and Sector Registry (EASR) or Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA).

Manitoba and the Territories was not captured. However, NEES is also a repository for previous Environment Canada spill datasets.  NEES is 
composed of the historic datasets ' or Trends ' which dates from approximately 1974 to present. NEES Trends is a compilation of historic databases, 
which were merged and includes data from NATES (National Analysis of Trends in Emergencies System), ARTS (Atlantic Regional Trends System), 
and NEES.  In 2001, the Emergencies Program determined that variations in reporting regimes and requirements between federal and provincial 
agencies made national spill reporting and trend analysis difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the department has focused efforts on capturing data 
on spills of substances which fall under its legislative authority only (CEPA and FA). As such, the NEES database will be decommissioned in December

h-Definitions
Database Descriptions: This section provides a detailed explanation for each database including: source, information available, time coverage, and
acronyms used. They are listed in alphabetic order.
Detail Report: This is the section of the report which provides the most detail for each individual record. Records are summarized by location, starting
with the project property followed by records in closest proximity.
Distance: The distance value is the distance between plotted points, not necessarily the distance between the sites' boundaries. All values are an
approximation.
Direction:  The direction value is the compass direction of the site in respect to the project property and/or center point of the report.
Elevation: The elevation value is taken from the location at which the records for the site address have been plotted. All values are an approximation.
Source: Google Elevation API.
Executive Summary: This portion of the report is divided into 3 sections:
'Report Summary'- Displays a chart indicating how many records fall on the project property and, within the report search radii.
'Site Report Summary'-Project Property'- This section lists all the records which fall on the project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report'
section.
'Site Report Summary-Surrounding Properties'- This section summarizes all records on adjacent properties, listing them in order of proximity from the
project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report' section.
Map Key: The map key number is assigned according to closest proximity from the project property. Map Key numbers always start at #1. The project
property will always have a map key of '1' if records are available. If there is a number in brackets beside the main number, this will indicate the number
of records on that specific property. If there is no number in brackets, there is only one record for that property.
The symbol and colour used indicates 'elevation': the red inverted triangle will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Lower Elevation', the yellow triangle will dictate
'ERIS Sites with Higher Elevation' and the orange square will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Same Elevation.'
Unplottables: These are records that could not be mapped due to various reasons, including limited geographic information. These records may or
may not be in your study area, and are included as reference.
