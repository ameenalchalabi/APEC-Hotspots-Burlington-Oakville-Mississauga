EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Pinchin Ltd. (Pinchin) was retained on January 17, 2023 through an Authorization to Proceed, Limitation 
of Liability and Terms of Engagement contract form signed by a representative of Mattamy (Milton West) 
Limited (Client) to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the property located at the 
northwest corner of the intersection between Regional Road 25 and Britannia Road, Milton, Ontario 
(hereafter referred to as the Site). The Site is comprised of two blocks; North and South of Etheridge 
Avenue. The Site is vacant and undeveloped, free of any permanent structures and/or buildings. 
Pinchin was advised by the Client that the purpose of the Phase I ESA was to assess potential issues of 
environmental concern in relation to the potential redevelopment of the Site.  
The Phase I ESA was completed in general accordance with the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) 
document entitled “Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, CSA Standard Z768-01” dated November 
2001 (reaffirmed 2022), as well as in general accordance with Ontario Regulation 153/04 as amended 
(O.Reg.153/04), including a review of readily-available historical records, a review of readily-accessible 
regulatory records, a Site reconnaissance, interviews, an evaluation of information and reporting, subject 
to the limitations outlined in Section 8.0 of this report.  
Based on the results of the Phase I ESA completed by Pinchin, nothing was identified that is likely to 
result in potential subsurface impacts at the Site. As such, no subsurface investigation work (Phase II 
ESA) is recommended at this time. 
This Executive Summary is subject to the same standard limitations as contained in the report and must be 
read in conjunction with the entire report.

Opta Information 
As part of the 2018 Pinchin Phase I ESA Report, Pinchin contacted Opta Information Intelligence (Opta) 
to obtain copies of Fire Insurance Plans related to the Site and surrounding area, as well as Property 
Underwriters’ Reports and Property Underwriters’ Plans related to the Site. Opta provided a written 
response dated March 13, 2018, indicating there were no records on-file for the Site. A copy of Opta’s 
response is provided in Appendix I. 
3.4 
City Directories 
As part of the 2018 Pinchin Phase I ESA Report, city directories for the years 1969/1970 to 2000 were 
reviewed by Pinchin at the Library and Archives of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. It should be noted that no 
city directories were available for the Town of Milton subsequent to 2000. A summary of information 
obtained with respect to the Site is provided in the following table: 
Year(s) 
Occupant Listings for Site Address 
1969/70 – 1979 
Residential 
1979 – 2000 
Not listed. 
In general, the city directories indicated that the surrounding area has historically consisted of agricultural 
and residential land uses since 1969. No historical dry cleaning operations, RFOs or other operations of 
potential environmental concern were identified, however, Pinchin notes the following: 
• 
Brower’s Machine and Tool was listed at 6003 Regional Road 25 from 1969 until 1979.  
This property is located approximately 45 m northeast of the Site and is inferred to be 
hydraulically transgradient of the Site relative to the inferred groundwater flow direction.

Based on the distance between the operation and the Site, as well as the inferred 
groundwater flow direction, it is Pinchin’s opinion that this historical off-Site operation is 
unlikely to result in potential subsurface impacts at the Site. 
3.5 
Previous Environmental Reports 
2018 Pinchin Phase I ESA Report 
The Phase I ESA completed by Pinchin in March 2018 consisted of historical reviews, a review of 
surrounding properties, a regulatory database search, and interviews as well as an exterior assessment 
of the Site. 
Pinchin also reviewed the following previous reports for the Site: 
• 
Report entitled “Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, Northwest Corner of Regional 
Road 25 and Britannia Road, Milton, Ontario”, prepared for Mattamy (Milton West) 
Limited c/o Shad and dated June 9, 2011 (2011 Pinchin Phase I ESA Report);

#114328” prepared by Pinchin and dated June 27, 2011 (2011 Pinchin RSC); and  
• 
Letter entitled “Acknowledgement of Filing of Record of Site Condition (RSC), RSC 
Number 114328, IDS Filing Number 7225-8JC3PK” prepared by the Ontario Ministry of 
the Environment (currently the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks 
(MECP)) and dated June 30, 2011 (MECP RSC Acknowledgement Letter). 
Based on Pinchin’s review of the 2011 Pinchin Phase I ESA Report, the following was noted: 
• 
The Phase I ESA completed by Pinchin in June 2011 consisted of historical reviews, a 
review of surrounding properties, a regulatory database search, and interviews as well as 
an exterior assessment of the Site, including parcels of land currently developed with a 
residential subdivision located northwest and southwest of the Site. 
• 
The results of the 2011 Pinchin Phase I ESA Report indicated that there were no 
significant potential environmental concerns associated with the current and historical 
use of the Site and adjacent properties and as such, no further environmental 
assessment work was recommended.  
Based on Pinchin’s review of the 2011 Pinchin RSC, the following was noted: 
• 
Based on the findings of the 2011 Pinchin Phase I ESA Report, Pinchin prepared the 
online forms to file an RSC with the MECP. The RSC indicated that the current property 
use was agricultural and that the intended property use was residential. The area of the 
lands associated with the RSC was 41.7 hectares (which includes the Site).

Based on Pinchin’s review of the MECP RSC Acknowledgement Letter, the following was noted: 
• 
The letter indicated that the MECP acknowledged the filing of the RSC for the property, 
including the Site on June 30, 2011 and that the RSC was filed on the Environmental Site 
Registry.  
The results of the 2018 Pinchin Phase I ESA Report indicated that there were no significant potential 
environmental concerns associated with the current and historical use of the Site and adjacent properties 
and as such, no further environmental assessment work was recommended. 
3.6 
Historical Summary 
Based on the results of the historical review, nothing was identified that is likely to result in potential 
subsurface impacts at the Site. 
4.0 
REGULATORY INFORMATION AND CORRESPONDENCE 
4.1 
Site Regulatory Information 
Pinchin requested copies of permits, approvals and registrations from the Client and was advised that 
there is no regulatory information with respect to the Site. 
4.2 
Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks 
A Freedom of Information request was submitted to the MECP for information on file with respect to the 
Site. Specifically, the MECP was asked what information it has regarding historical spills, orders, 
investigations/prosecutions, waste generator numbers/classes, Certificates-of-Approval and 
Environmental Compliance Approvals. Based on written correspondence with the MECP dated January 
24, 2023, no information was on file with respect to the Site. A copy of the MECP’s response is provided 
in Appendix II of this report. 
The MECP Brownfields Environmental Site Registry was searched by ERIS as part of the database 
searches completed. According to the ERIS report, and as noted above, a RSC has been filed for the 
properties located northwest and southwest of the Site and including the Site. The RSC indicates the 
following information: 
• 
The RSC (#114328) was issued on June 9, 2011 and permitted a change of land use 
from agricultural/other to residential; 
• 
The Site was a portion of the RSC Site boundary, the total RSC Site boundary was 41.7 
hectares;

4.3 
Technical Standards & Safety Authority 
The Technical Standards & Safety Authority (TSSA) was contacted to establish the status of the Site with 
respect to its files, to identify outstanding instructions, tank registrations, incident reports, fuel/oil spills or 
contamination records associated with the Site. Based on written correspondence with the TSSA dated 
January 29, 2023, no information was on file with respect to the Site. Copies of Pinchin’s request 
submitted to the TSSA and their response is provided in Appendix II of this report. 
4.4 
ERIS 
Pinchin submitted a request to ERIS for a review of their available databases, as they pertain to the Site 
and surrounding properties.  
A copy of the ERIS report is provided in Appendix III. Based on a review of the information obtained from 
the above-noted sources, Pinchin notes the following:  
• 
The Site was not listed in any the databases reviewed by Pinchin; 
• 
The Ontario Spills database indicated that on October 15, 2007, 15 L of biosolids spilled 
to Britannia Road east of Regional Road 25 due to equipment failure. The ERIS report 
indicated that environmental impact to land was confirmed. This spill occurred 
approximately 10 m east of the Site and was situated hydraulically down/transgradient of 
the Site relative to the inferred groundwater flow direction. Based on the limited quantity 
of the release, as well as the nature of the spill, it is Pinchin’s opinion that the historical 
spill is unlikely to result in subsurface impacts to the Site; 
• 
Dolby and Few Haulage Ltd. located at 6009 Regional Road 25, had been identified in 
the Fuel Storage Tank, Fuel Storage Tank – Historic and the Private and Retail Fuel 
Storage Tanks databases with one active 9,092-Litres (L) steel single wall diesel 
underground storage tank (UST) installed in 1979. This property is located approximately 
45 m northeast of the Site and is situated hydraulically transgradient of the Site relative to 
the inferred groundwater flow direction.  Based on the distance between this property and 
the Site, as well as the inferred groundwater flow direction, it is Pinchin’s opinion that the 
historical UST is unlikely to result in subsurface impacts to the Site; and 
• 
Bot Engineering & Construction Ltd., located at 8066 Britannia Road East, had been 
registered with the MECP as a generator of waste oils and lubricants as of December 
2018. Based on a review of Pinchin’s in-house MECP Waste Generator database, no 
wastes were generated by this operation. This property is located approximately 30 m 
east of the Site and is situated hydraulically transgradient of the Site relative to the 
inferred groundwater flow direction; and

• 
Additional surrounding properties were listed in various databases reviewed; however, 
based on the information provided within the ERIS report, the locations/distances 
between these properties and the Site, as well as the inferred groundwater flow direction, 
it is Pinchin’s opinion that the potential issues of concern associated with these listings 
are unlikely to result in potential subsurface impacts at the Site. 
4.5 
Regulatory Information Summary 
Based on the regulatory information reviewed, nothing was identified that is likely to result in potential 
subsurface impacts at the Site.

SITE RECONNAISSANCE  
Pinchin (see Appendix IV for assessor qualifications) conducted a Site reconnaissance on January 24, 
2023, and was accompanied by the Site Representative. The Site reconnaissance included a walk-
through of accessible areas of the construction trailers and exterior areas of the Site. At the time of the 
Site reconnaissance, the ground surface was partially covered with snow limiting exterior observations, 
and the weather was clear. The Site reconnaissance was documented with notes and photographs. The 
results of the Site reconnaissance are discussed below. Photographs of some of the features noted 
during the Site reconnaissance are attached in Appendix V. 
5.1 
Hazardous Materials 
Topic 
Findings 
Chemicals 
Chemicals typically used for general purpose cleaning, and building maintenance 
(e.g., window cleaners, bleach, paints, deodorizers, etc.) were noted on-Site at the 
time of the Site reconnaissance. Chemicals observed on-Site were stored within 
manufacturer-supplied containers in various locations within the construction trailers. 
Compressed 
Gases 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative. 
Hazardous 
Waste 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative. 
No spills or evidence of historical spills (i.e., staining) were observed in the chemical storage areas noted 
above. The interior floor boards were observed to be in good condition (i.e., no cracking or pitting) and the 
chemicals appeared to be stored in an orderly fashion. No floor drains or catch basins were present in the 
vicinity of the chemical storage areas.

5.2 
Storage Tanks 
5.2.1 
Aboveground Storage Tanks 
No aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) were observed on-Site, and none were reported by the Site 
Representative. No evidence of former ASTs was observed by Pinchin. 
5.2.2 
Underground Storage Tanks 
No evidence of underground storage tanks (USTs) (i.e., fill/vent pipes) was observed on-Site, and none 
were reported by the Site Representative. No evidence of former USTs was observed by Pinchin. 
5.3 
Water and Wastewater 
Topic 
Findings 
Water Supply Source 
Region of Halton. Water is obtained by the Region from Lake Ontario. 
Groundwater is not used as a source of potable water. 
Water Use 
Water is primarily used for domestic-related activities within the construction 
trailers. 
Sanitary/Process 
Wastewater Receptor 
Municipal sanitary sewer system. No process wastewater is generated at the 
Site. Wastewater is limited to sanitary effluent.  
Pits, Sumps or Lagoons 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative.  
Grease Traps 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative. 
Oil/Water Separators 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative. 
Storm Water Flow and 
Receptor 
Storm water would likely run overland to percolate naturally through the soil 
or discharge into the tributary of Sixteen Mile Creek adjacent to the 
southwest Site boundary. 
Wells 
Seven groundwater monitoring wells were observed on-Site at the time of 
the Site reconnaissance, as shown on Figure 2. It is Pinchin’s understanding 
that these groundwater monitoring wells were installed as part of a 
geotechnical investigation completed at the Site by Shad. 
Watercourses, Ditches 
or Standing Water 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative. 
5.4 
Hydraulic Equipment 
No evidence of hydraulic equipment (i.e., hydraulic hoists, elevators, compactors, dock levels, etc.) was 
identified at the Site during the Site reconnaissance.

5.5 
Polychlorinated Biphenyls 
The use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in electrical equipment such as transformers, fluorescent 
lamp ballasts, and capacitors was common until Canada banned its use in 1980. The Federal PCB 
Regulations, SOR/2008-273, regulate the manufacture, import, export, sale, use and processing of PCBs. 
These regulations required the decommissioning of equipment containing high levels of PCBs (>500 
ppm) in 2009. Additionally, the regulations require decommissioning of light ballasts, pole top 
transformers, capacitors and electrical equipment containing greater than 50 mg/kg PCBs by December 
31, 2025. Cables, pipelines and equipment associated with natural gas, petroleum and petroleum 
products, and fusion sealed capacitors for use in communication equipment and electrical control 
equipment are exempt from the decommissioning requirement. 
Given that there are no permanent structures on-Site, PCBs are not considered an issue. 
5.6 
Asbestos-Containing Materials 
Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) are commonly found in building construction materials (particularly 
in older buildings). Asbestos use in building products declined in use starting in the 1970s, with the 
majority of products being phased out by circa 1990. Asbestos use in Canada was formally banned in 
December 2018. 
Friable asbestos (friable is defined as a material that can be crumbled, powdered or pulverized by hand 
pressure) was widely used in sprayed fireproofing until 1973, and in decorative or finishing plasters, and 
thermal systems insulation until the early 1980s. Non-friable or manufactured asbestos products were 
widely used in building construction including in vinyl floor tiles, sheet flooring, ceiling tiles, pipe gaskets, 
roofing materials, asbestos cement boards, and numerous other products until circa 1990. A limited 
number of non-friable asbestos products remained in use until the end of 2018; examples include friction 
materials, gaskets, cement pipes, sealants, adhesives and caulking.  
Given that there are no permanent structures on-Site, ACMs is not considered an issue. 
5.7 
Lead-Containing Paints 
Lead was commonly used as an additive in paints with no restricted level up until the mid-1970s. This 
included architectural paints used on interior and exterior surfaces, primers and coatings for anti-corrosive 
purposes, consumer paints, and paint on furniture and other household items. Beginning in 1976, the 
federal government limited the amount of lead in consumer paints to 5,000 parts per million (ppm) and 
steadily reduced the lead content, primarily in the interest of public safety. In 2005, the limit was reduced 
to 600 ppm and in 2010, the limit was further reduced to 90 ppm, however, there is no restriction on lead 
in paints used for anti-corrosion purposes (e.g., steel primers and exterior coatings) and road and line 
markings. In June 2016, these exemptions were removed and as of this date, any paint sold should not 
contain more than 90 ppm, even if sold for anti-corrosion purposes.

Given that there are no permanent structures on-Site, lead containing paints are not considered an issue. 
5.8 
Ozone-Depleting Substances 
The bulk storage of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) was not observed. The Site Representative 
reported that the bulk storage of ODSs has not been carried out at the Site. 
Air-conditioning units, as well as residential refrigeration units, were observed on-Site. These units may 
include refrigerants, such as R22 or R12, that are noted within the phase-out schedules for elimination in 
both Provincial and Federal regulations. No other sources of ODSs were observed at the time of the Site 
reconnaissance. 
5.9 
Radon 
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas formed by the breakdown of uranium in soil, rocks and 
even groundwater. Radon is invisible, odourless and colourless and as such, cannot be detected by 
humans. Radon escapes from the ground and mixes with outdoor air forming concentrations that are too 
low to be of concern; however, if radon enters a building the concentrations can increase to higher levels. 
Health Canada has developed guidelines for acceptable levels of radon in dwellings and public buildings 
and has indicated that radon levels should not exceed 200 Becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3). Testing 
for radon in the Site Building was beyond the scope of this Phase I ESA. The Site Representative 
reported that no radon surveys have been carried out at the Site. 
5.10 
Mould or Microbial Contamination 
The presence of mould or other microbiological contamination in buildings has become a concern to 
building tenants and owners due to potential health effects on occupants and users. Provincial Ministries 
of Labour have recently issued guidelines on enforced regulations to protect the health of construction 
workers who are exposed to mould in the course of building renovation. The presence of water leaks or 
high humidity can cause the growth or amplification of mould within building environments. 
Given that there are no permeant structures on-Site, mould or microbial contamination is not considered 
to be an issue. Pinchin notes that water staining was observed in the construction trailers on-Site, 
however, no visible mould was observed during Site reconnaissance. 
5.11 
Air Emissions 
Topic 
Findings 
Washroom Vents 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative.

Topic 
Findings 
Heating/Cooling 
Not applicable. However, the temporary sales centre and construction trailers 
located on-Site are heated and cooled with natural gas-fired wall mounted 
units, electric baseboard heaters and electrically powered air conditioning 
units. 
Emergency Generators 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative. 
Process Vents 
None observed and none reported by the Site Representative. 
Odours 
No strong, pungent or noxious odours were identified. 
Permits / Approvals 
Client advised Pinchin that Site does not hold any permits/approvals for the 
Site, as related to air emissions or discharges. 
5.12 
Staining and Stressed Vegetation 
Pinchin notes that the ground surface was partially snow covered at the time of the Site reconnaissance 
and therefore, a thorough assessment for staining/stressed vegetation could not be completed at the time 
of the Site reconnaissance.  
No evidence of historical chemical discharges or releases (i.e., staining or stressed vegetation) was 
observed during the Site reconnaissance. The Site Representative reported that no known historical 
chemical spills have occurred on-Site and no reportable spills were documented in the regulatory 
databases searched. As such, the partially snow-covered ground surface does not represent a significant 
gap that would affect the Qualified Person (QP) opinion regarding the Site condition. 
5.13 
Non-Hazardous Wastes 
Topic 
Findings 
Non-hazardous 
Wastes 
Domestic refuse is deposited in a metal bin located west of the construction trailers 
and is removed for off-Site disposal by GFL approximately monthly.   
Recyclables 
Recyclables (i.e., cans, bottles, newsprint, plastics, and cardboard) are stored in a 
metal bin located west of the construction trailers and is removed to an off-Site 
recycling facility by GFL approximately monthly.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the results of the Phase I ESA completed by Pinchin, nothing was identified that is likely to 
result in potential subsurface impacts at the Site. As such, it is the opinion of the QP that the Site 
conditions observed at the time of filing the RSC have not changed significantly and RSC is still valid. No 
subsurface investigation work (Phase II ESA) is recommended at this time. 
8.0

Limitations and Notices: 
TSSA Fuels Safety: 
If you have environmental concerns regarding this property, you should consider hiring an 
environmental consultant to conduct an environmental assessment of the property in question. 
 Sites that have not been licensed since 1987 may not be in TSSA records. 
 Be advised, TSSA Fuels Safety Division did not register: 
• 
private fuel underground/ aboveground storage tanks prior to January of 1990; and 
•  furnace oil tanks prior to May 1, 2002.  
 
 Fuels Safety Division does not register  
• 
private waste oil tanks in apartments, office buildings, residences etc.; and 
• 
aboveground gas or diesel tanks. 
 
 The Technical Standards and Safety Act and associated regulations do not require the 
registration of private fuel outlets, nor does it require that any documentation on these facilities be 
submitted to or reviewed or approved by TSSA.  As a result, TSSA has limited information on 
these facilities.  TSSA cautions that any information provided may be inaccurate, incomplete or 
out of date. 
TSSA Elevating & Amusement Devices Program Notice: 
 All orders and/or directions issued by the TSSA Inspector have a compliance date and the owner or 
designated contractor are required to comply within the specified time limit. Compliance is the 
responsibility of the owner or operator of the device. 
 All written declarations of compliance (where eligible) should be sent to TSSA. Once a declaration of 
compliance has been received, the outstanding order will be resolved. 
 Each report shows the details and date of the inspection conducted by TSSA at the requested 
location. 
 The Ontario Amusement Devices Regulation (O. Reg. 221/01) was adopted in 2001. Since that time, 
TSSA retains copies of technical dossiers of new amusement devices in Ontario (as per TSSA’s 
retention policy). However, for rides that existed prior to the adoption of the Regulation, which were 
subject to a “grandfathering-in” clause, technical dossiers were not required to be filed with the TSSA. 
However, if the amusement ride remains in operation, as per ASTM requirements, the owner/licensee 
must possess an operations document for the device in question. 
Federal Elevators 
 Please be advised that without the express written consent of the owner, the TSSA does not release 
any information with respect to federal elevators or federal elevating equipment. The TSSA is a 
provincial regulator for the province of Ontario and federal elevators do not fall within the scope of 
TSSA’s provincial mandate and the Technical Standards and Safety Act and associated Regulations. 
Further, the TSSA’s Access and Privacy Code only applies to information collected, used, or disclosed 
by the TSSA in the course of TSSA’s administration of the Act. Therefore, information with respect to 
federal elevators or federal elevator equipment is outside of the administration of the Act, and outside 
of the scope of the TSSA’s Access and Privacy Codes. 
Indigenous Lands 
 
Please be advised that the TSSA does not release any information with respect to indigenous lands, 
which are outside of the TSSA’s mandate, without the express written permission from the Band. The 
Technical Standards and Safety Act, associated regulations, and TSSA’s Access and Privacy Code 
does not apply to indigenous lands. 
Page 3 of 3 
TSSA Boilers and Pressure Vessels (BPVs) Program Notice: 
 Be advised, TSSA does not typically periodically inspect BPVs. These inspections are usually 
performed by insurance companies.  
 **Inspection reports may not be submitted to TSSA by insurance companies; therefore, while TSSA 
may have some evidence of a BPV at a location on file, there may be no inspection records pertaining 
to BPVs located at the address provided. 
 As of July 1, 2018, BPVs in Ontario may not be operated unless the Director has issued a current 
certificate of inspection (COI) to the owner or operator.  A COI will be issued to the owner or operator 
of the BPV by TSSA after TSSA has received a Record of Inspection (ROI) from the insurer/third-party 
inspector, the associated fees have been paid and the BPV has passed a periodic inspection. 
 Please note that if the BPV in question is insured, the insurance company may have additional 
inspection records.  Please contact the insurer directly should you wish to obtain further information.

National Environmental Emergencies System (NEES):
Federal
rr-NEES-bb
In 2000, the Emergencies program implemented NEES, a reporting system for spills of hazardous substances.  For the most part, this system only 
captured data from the Atlantic Provinces, some from Quebec and Ontario and a portion from British Columbia. Data for Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and the Territories was not captured. However, NEES is also a repository for previous Environment Canada spill datasets.  NEES is 
composed of the historic datasets ' or Trends ' which dates from approximately 1974 to present. NEES Trends is a compilation of historic databases, 
which were merged and includes data from NATES (National Analysis of Trends in Emergencies System), ARTS (Atlantic Regional Trends System), 
and NEES.  In 2001, the Emergencies Program determined that variations in reporting regimes and requirements between federal and provincial 
agencies made national spill reporting and trend analysis difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the department has focused efforts on capturing data 
on spills of substances which fall under its legislative authority only (CEPA and FA). As such, the NEES database will be decommissioned in December 
2004.

h-Definitions
Database Descriptions: This section provides a detailed explanation for each database including: source, information available, time coverage, and
acronyms used. They are listed in alphabetic order.
Detail Report: This is the section of the report which provides the most detail for each individual record. Records are summarized by location, starting
with the project property followed by records in closest proximity.
Distance: The distance value is the distance between plotted points, not necessarily the distance between the sites' boundaries. All values are an
approximation.
Direction:  The direction value is the compass direction of the site in respect to the project property and/or center point of the report.
Elevation: The elevation value is taken from the location at which the records for the site address have been plotted. All values are an approximation.
Source: Google Elevation API.
Executive Summary: This portion of the report is divided into 3 sections:
'Report Summary'- Displays a chart indicating how many records fall on the project property and, within the report search radii.
'Site Report Summary'-Project Property'- This section lists all the records which fall on the project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report'
section.
'Site Report Summary-Surrounding Properties'- This section summarizes all records on adjacent properties, listing them in order of proximity from the
project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report' section.
Map Key: The map key number is assigned according to closest proximity from the project property. Map Key numbers always start at #1. The project
property will always have a map key of '1' if records are available. If there is a number in brackets beside the main number, this will indicate the number
of records on that specific property. If there is no number in brackets, there is only one record for that property.
The symbol and colour used indicates 'elevation': the red inverted triangle will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Lower Elevation', the yellow triangle will dictate
'ERIS Sites with Higher Elevation' and the orange square will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Same Elevation.'
Unplottables: These are records that could not be mapped due to various reasons, including limited geographic information. These records may or
may not be in your study area, and are included as reference.
