Executive Summary 
Palmer is pleased to provide this Phase One Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) report to Edenshaw 
SSR Developments Limited.  The Phase One ESA was prepared for the parcel of land located at 49 South 
Service Road, Mississauga, ON (hereafter collectively referred to as the “Phase One Property”). 
 
It is Palmer’s understanding that the purpose of this Phase One ESA is to support development approval 
applications with the City of Mississauga and is required to support filing of a Record of Site Condition 
(RSC) with the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP). The Phase One Property 
(also referred to as the "Subject Property" or "Site") is contemplated for residential redevelopments with a 
22-storey tower, 4-storey podium, and an underground parking following demolition of the existing buildings.  
The Phase One ESA Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule D of Ontario Regulation 
407/19 (amending Ontario Regulation 153/04) under the Environmental Protection Act (EPA).  The Phase 
One ESA includes an assessment of the Site and adjacent and neighbouring lands within a 250-metre (m) 
radius from the boundary of the Phase One Property (hereafter referred to as the “Phase One Study Area”).  
 
The Phase One Property is a 1.09-acre, irregular shaped, parcel of land located on the south side of Queen 
Elizabeth Way, north of the intersection with Hurontario Street in Mississauga, Ontario. Building structures 
on the Site include a 334-m2 two-storey former Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) office building (with a partial 
basement) with a 111-m2 single-storey attached detention area, a 143-m2 garage, and two (2) canopy 
structures. The Phase One Property has been vacant since August 2020. The remaining parts of the Site 
comprise an asphalt-paved parking lot and landscaped grassed areas. 
 
The Phase One Study Area (“surrounding area”) covers land uses within a 250 metre (m) radius of the 
Phase One Property.  The Phase One Study Area is developed with commercial, residential, and 
institutional land uses. 
 
There are no water bodies or areas of natural significance on the Phase One Property.  However, Mary Fix 
Creek exists approximately 230 m south of the Phase One Property in the Phase One Study Area, which 
flows southeastward to Lake Ontario. 
 
Historically, the Site was first developed prior to 1952 with a single building on the southern portion of the 
Phase One Property. The Phase One Property was subsequently redeveloped in the early 1960s with the 
current buildings. Tenants of the building have included the OPP. 
 
Based on the findings of the historical records review, Site reconnaissance, and personal interviews, it was 
concluded that five (5) potentially contaminating activities (PCAs) were identified either on the Phase One 
Property or within the Phase One Study Area.  These PCAs were deemed to be contributing to five (5) 
areas of potential environmental concern (APECs) on the Phase One Property.  The identified PCAs and 
APECs are as follows:

A Phase Two ESA is recommended to assess subsurface impacts as a result of the aforementioned PCAs 
and APECs.  The scope of the Phase Two ESA should entail the analysis of representative soil and ground 
water samples from the Phase One Property for the contaminants of potential concern identified; including 
PHCs, BTEX, VOCs, Metals, As, Sb, and Se. In addition, based on the presence of asbestos and other 
designated substances within the on-site buildings, a Designated Substances Survey is recommended prior 
to any demolition activities, which may also be required by the City of Mississauga prior to issuing a 
demolition permit. 
 
The statements made in this Executive Summary are subject to the same limitations as contained in the 
report and should be read in conjunction with the entire report.

1.2 
Scope of Investigation 
The Phase One ESA was completed in accordance with Schedule D of Ontario Regulation 407/19 
(amending Ontario Regulation 153/04) under the EPA. The purpose of the Phase One ESA is to establish 
if potential environmental impacts are likely to be present on the Phase One Property as a result of previous 
or current land use on or in the vicinity of the Phase One Property. The following key components were 
completed as part of the assessment:  
 
 
Review of historical information (i.e. previous reports, site operating records, fire insurance plans, 
aerial photographs, occupancy search, etc.); 
 
Request and review of applicable documents (i.e. maps, provincial and federal archives, etc.); 
 
Review of applicable federal and provincial databases; 
 
Site reconnaissance and interviews with knowledgeable site representatives; 
 
Collections of photographs showing the current and past uses of the Site and surrounding area, as 
well as potentially contaminating activities (PCAs) and areas of potential environmental 
contamination (APECs);  
 
Tables and maps summarizing and providing the location of each PCA and APEC; 
 
Evaluation of information from records review, interviews and site reconnaissance; and 
 
Completion of a conceptual site model (CSM). 
 
The Phase One ESA report was prepared for use by Edenshaw SSR Developments Limited based on 
information collected by qualified Palmer staff members in May 2022. The Phase One ESA was prepared 
by Bailey Fleet, B.Sc.(Env.) under direct supervision by Sarah Sipak, B.Sc., P.Geo (limited), a “Qualified 
Person” (QPESA) as defined by Ontario Regulation 153/04. The qualifications of these Palmer members are 
summarized in Section 8.0.

Records Review 
2.1 
General Records 
2.1.1 
Phase One ESA Study Area Determination 
The qualified person (QP), Sarah Sipak, B.Sc., P. Geo. (limited), overseeing this Phase One ESA 
determined that the conventional distance of 250 m from the Site boundaries was adequate for defining the 
Phase One Study Area for all records reviewed. The limits of the Phase One Study Area are depicted on 
Figure 1. 
2.1.2 
First Developed Use Determination  
The first developed use of the Phase One Property was determined through the records review as detailed 
throughout Section 2 of the Phase One ESA report and summarized below.  
 
An illustrated atlas from 1877 revealed that the Phase One Property was a vacant portion of a much larger 
block of land consisting of one (1) single residential dwelling, likely a farmstead, owned by Sir Henry Parker. 
 
A 1952 Fire Insurance Plan depicted the Phase One Property as developed with a former smaller building 
occupied by Ontario Provincial Police (addressed as 1635 Centre Street), a former automobile garage 
building (addressed as 1635A Centre Street), and a former dwelling.  
 
An aerial photograph taken in 1954 showed the Phase One Property to comprise three (3) former buildings, 
a landscaped and wooded area, and an access road from Queen Elizabeth Way.  
 
An aerial photograph taken in 1966 depicted the Phase One Property in its current commercial configuration 
with the current commercial buildings and parking lot. 
 
Aerial photographs taken between 1966 and 2020 showed the Phase One Property to have no significant 
changes made over time. Aerial photographs are shown in Appendix B. 
2.1.3 
Fire Insurance Plans 
Fire insurance plans (FIPs) were produced between the late 1880’s until the 1970s for urban communities 
throughout Canada. FIPs provided an illustrated resource that detailed the materials, occupancies, and 
potential fire hazards of existing buildings. The locations of above and below ground fuel storage tanks 
(ASTs/USTs) were also depicted on these plans. 
 
Environmental Risk Information Services (ERIS) was retained to conduct a search for available FIPs or 
inspection report related documents pertaining to the Phase One Property or Study Area in order to provide 
additional information regarding historic usage and development at the site. The results of this search are 
summarized in Table 1.

Previous Environmental Reports  
Six (6) reports relating to the environmental conditions at the Phase One Property were provided and 
reviewed.  A summary of the description of relevant report data, analysis and findings relevant to the Phase 
One ESA, including the presence of a contaminant on, in or under the Phase One Property or the existence 
of an area of potential environmental concern, is as follows: 
 
Report Title: Phase One Environmental Site Assessment, Mississauga OPP Detachment, 49 South 
Service Road, Mississauga, Ontario  
Date: December 21, 2020 
Prepared by: GHD Limited 
Prepared for: Infrastructure Ontario 
 
A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was conducted at 49 South Service Road, Mississauga 
on December 21, 2020 by GHD Limited (GHD). It was required that the site be assessed to document 
environmental conditions for the potential disposition of the Property. The site consisted of a former Ontario 
Provincial Police (OPP) detachment building, an associated garage and two canopy structures. Historic site 
operations were identified as potential agricultural use up to the 1940s and commercial use (Ontario 
Provincial Police) since at least the early 1950s to 2020. Surface water along the site drains overland

towards catch basins on the property and potable water is supplied by the Region of Peel. No potable well 
or onsite septic tank systems were observed during the site reconnaissance performed by GHD. The 
wastewater discharges were identified to consist of domestic wastewater, wastewater from kitchen sinks 
and floor drain systems generated within the main building and discharged to the municipal sanitary system, 
as well as any wash water or runoff associated with vehicle maintenance generated within the garage 
building and collected in the trench drain system and a catch basin in the garage which are connected to 
the municipal sewer system. The ground water flow direction was anticipated to be in a southerly direction, 
towards Lake Ontario. In the Phase One ESA, GHD identified five (5) PCAs which lead to five (5) APECs. 
The APECs included on-site historical pesticide use, unknown fill material quality, vehicle servicing garage, 
potential historical UST, and fuel storage tank integrated within a diesel fuel backup generator. 
 
Report Title: Phase Two Environmental Site Assessment, Mississauga OPP Detachment, 49 South 
Service Road, Mississauga, Ontario 
Date: April 1, 2021 
Prepared by: GHD Limited 
Prepared for: Infrastructure Ontario 
 
A Phase Two ESA was conducted at 49 South Service Road by GHD to address the areas of potential 
environmental concern (APECs) identified during the 2020 Phase One ESA. The investigation occurred 
between December 3 and 21, 2020. A total of ten (10) boreholes (BHs) were drilled to a maximum depth 
of 4.47 metres below ground surface (mbgs) and four (4) monitoring wells (MW1-20 to MW4-20) were 
installed. Groundwater flow direction was identified in the southeastern direction and depth to groundwater 
ranged from 2.64 to 3.50 mbgs. 
 
Table 3, Full Depth Generic Site Condition Standards in a Non-Potable Groundwater Condition, for 
Industrial/Commercial/Community Property Use, coarse-textured soil, were chosen for the subject site. 
Based on the results of the Phase Two ESA, no specific impacts were identified to be related to the APECs 
revealed in the Phase One ESA. Inorganic parameters including Sodium Adsorption Ration (SAR) and/or 
electrical conductivity (EC) were found to exceed Table 3 standards in the southern portion of the site. 
Additionally, groundwater in the southern portion of the site was found to exceed Table 3 standards for 
chloride. It was reported that these exceedances were most likely due to the use of road salt for de-icing 
purposes. 
 
GHD concluded that amendments made to O. Reg. 153/04, related to the use of road de-icing salt to keep 
a property safe under conditions of snow and ice, indicate that the exemption outlined under Section 49.1 
would apply to the Site. Therefore, if an RSC is required in the future, the Qualified Person could conclude 
that Standards for EC and SAR in soil and chloride in groundwater are “deemed to be met”.

Report Title: Asbestos Building Materials Reassessment Survey Report 
Date: November 15, 2013 
Prepared by: Environmental Consulting Occupational Health (ECOH) 
Prepared for: CBRE Limited 
 
An Asbestos Building Materials Reassessment Survey Report was conducted at 49 South Service Road 
by ECOH Inc. and exp. Services Inc. (ECOH-exp.). This report was carried out for the purposes of long-
term management of the asbestos-containing building materials for both the OPP detachment building and 
garage on the Site. The assessment found that asbestos materials were detected within pipe insulation in 
the pump room of the OPP detachment building. Asbestos was also identified within the roof hopper drain 
and all piping insulation within the garage building. No visible damage or deterioration was noted on the 
identified asbestos containing materials; therefore, no immediate remedial action was required.

2.2.1 
Municipal Records Database 
A written request was filed on May 24, 2022 for information concerning control orders, violation notices, 
and other environmental concerns for the Phase One Property with the City of Mississauga Records and 
Freedom of Information Department.  No information has been received to date.  Any forthcoming 
documentation from the aforementioned regulatory agency will be reviewed, and if the response specifies 
any environmental concerns, it will be addressed and forwarded to the Client.  A copy of this 
correspondence is presented in Appendix F. 
2.2.2 
Provincial Records Database 
A Freedom of Information request was filed on May 20, 2022 for information relating to any control orders, 
violation notices, or other environmental concerns with the MECP.  A response was received on September 
27, 2022, stating that records pertaining to the property were located.  
 
The first record was related to an incident report dated January 6, 2009, which was reported by the Region 
of Peel and SNC Lavalin and documented by the MECPs Spills Action Centre (SAC). The record states 
that an on-site tank, which collects oily water pumped from a sump, overflowed sometime between January 
4 and January 6, 2009. Water levels in the on-site collection tank were typically monitored weekly. It was 
also reported that a historic UST was located in the front parking lot in approximately 1997. Previous 
investigations determined that low level hydrocarbons were entering the sump and were likely from this 
UST which is why the collection tank was installed. After the spill, sampling of the potentially impacted storm 
drain was completed by Safe Tech. The outfall of this storm drain is unknown. It was reported to SAC that 
99% of the spill was composed of water and believed to be contained in the catch basin. The record 
indicates that absorbent pads were placed in the catch basin and oil was not detected. Trace amounts of 
oil located in the sump were also absorbed with a sponge and removed.  
 
The next record was related to an incident report dated October 15, 1999, which was documented by the 
MECPs SAC. The record states that there was a strong sewage odour in the vicinity of 49 South Service 
Road. The source of the odour was unknown to the caller, but the record also states that the source was 
1300 Lakeshore Road East. The record does not include additional information.  
 
A copy of the MECP response is presented in Appendix G. 
 
A total of eight (8) provincial records were available for the Phase One Property and thirty-five (35) records 
for the 250 m search radius from ERIS.  The records are summarized as follows, with identification of 
existence of a PCA:

Summary: 
The Phase One Property was used for commercial purposes since at least 1966 to 2020. Prior to 1966, the 
Phase One Property was developed with smaller structures, trees and an access road. The Phase One 
Property is depicted with the current main building and attached garage since 1966. No significant changes 
have occurred to the Phase One Property since this time. The surrounding Study Area primarily consisted 
of farmland, institutional and residential land in 1954. The Study Area has consisted of mostly residential, 
institutional and commercial infrastructure since 1966. The Study Area includes the Queen Elizabeth Way, 
as well as on and off-ramps, which have been present since 1954 and since redeveloped. Residential and 
commercial infrastructure within the Study Area have continued to be developed over time.

2.3.2 
Topography, Hydrology, Geology 
The Phase One Property is located at a topographic elevation of approximately 101 m above mean sea 
level.  Topography at and in the general vicinity of the Site is relatively flat with a drop in elevation to the 
southeast as shown in Figure 2. 
 
The Phase One Property is located within the broad physiographic region known as the Iroquois Plain 
(Chapman and Putnam, 1984).  This region is a slightly sloping plain that is covered with stratified sands 
of various depths in some areas and soil formed directly on the wave-eroded surface of red and gray shale 
in others.  This region borders Lake Ontario and extends around the western part of Lake Ontario from the 
Niagara River to the Trent River. 
 
Local surficial geologic mapping (The Ontario Geological Survey, 2003) of the Mississauga area indicates 
that coarse-textured glaciolacustrine deposits of sand, gravel, and minor silt and clay underlie the Phase 
One Property. 
 
Bedrock geologic mapping of Ontario (The Ontario Geological Survey, 1990) indicates that the glacially 
derived overburden soil at the Phase One Property is underlain by Upper Ordovician Age shale, limestone, 
dolostone, and siltstone of the Georgian Bay Formation. 
 
A Radon Potential Map of Ontario revealed that the subject property is located within Zone 2 (Radon 
Potential Map Ontario, 2013).  This Zone is designated as an elevated relative radon hazard.  Therefore, 
emissions of radon in the vicinity of the Sites are of a potential environmental concern. 
 
No water bodies or areas of natural significance were observed on the subject property.  Mary Fix Creek 
exists approximately 230 m south of the Site in the Phase One Study Area.  The local hydrogeology is 
controlled by this waterbody, the underlying geology and the topography and is surmised to be directed 
southeastward. 
 
Regional ground water flow is expected to be southeastward towards Lake Ontario. The static ground water 
level in the vicinity of the Phase One Property is noted to be around 3.4 m below existing grade based on 
well records in the vicinity of the Phase One Property. 
2.3.3 
Fill Materials 
No fill materials were observed on the Phase One Property. 
2.3.4 
Water Bodies, Areas of Natural Significance & Ground Water Information 
There are no water bodies on the Phase One Property.  Mary Fix Creek exists approximately 230 m south 
of the Phase One Property in the Phase One Study Area, which flows southeastward to Lake Ontario.  Lake 
Ontario is located approximately 2.5 km southeast of the Phase One Property. 
 
There are no areas of natural significance on the Phase One Property or within the Phase One Study Area. 
 
Local source water protection mapping (Source Protection Information Atlas, 2020) of the Mississauga area 
indicates there are no well-head protection areas in the vicinity of the Phase One Property; however, the 
Phase One Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) 
 
 
October 13, 2022

northern portion of the Phase One Property falls within intake protection Zone 2. There are significant 
ground water recharge areas present in the vicinity of the Phase One Property located at the west and 
south portions of the Study Area.  In addition, a highly vulnerable aquifer was noted to be present within 
the Phase One Property and Phase One Study Area. 
 
The Phase One Property is currently serviced by a municipal drinking water system.  However, there are 
two (2) well records for the Phase One Property and three (3) well records within a 250 m search radius.  
These records relate to test holes and observation wells in the Phase One Study Area. At the time of the 
Site reconnaissance, there was no visual evidence suggesting that a potable water well was located at the 
Site; however, the reviewed 1955 Plumbing and Water Supply plans revealed the presence of a former well 
water storage tank. Previously installed monitoring wells and boreholes were observed throughout the 
exterior of the Site and two (2) monitoring wells inside the main building. Palmer observed indications for 
the potential presence of an old septic tank formerly used at the Site, located at the north portion of the 
Phase One Property within the grass-landscaped area. Palmer’s review of the Legal Survey and historic 
building plans provided by the representatives for the owner indicate the presence of a concrete septic tank 
and a former septic field at the northern area of the Phase One Property, which are no longer in use.   
2.3.5 
Well Records 
As previously discussed in Section 2.2.2, there are two (2) well records for the Phase One Property and 
three (3) well records within a 250 m search radius.  These records relate to test holes and monitoring wells 
in the Phase One Property and Study Area. 
 
A review of these records does not provide detailed information; however, available data is summarized as 
follows:

Phase One Property Reconnaissance 
4.1 
Written Description of Investigation 
The purpose of the Site reconnaissance was to determine if APECs exist, through observations about 
current and past uses and PCAs on, in or under the Phase One Property and within the Phase One Study 
Area, as well as to identify potential contaminant pathways. Exterior observations of the Phase One 
Property and surrounding properties were conducted. The exterior observations were recorded by walking 
over the grounds. Adjoining properties and properties within the Phase One Study Area were observed 
from within the grounds of the Phase One Property and public roadways.   
 
An investigation of the Phase One Property was completed by Bailey Fleet, B.Sc.(Env.) and Kalina 
Naydenova, M.Sc., of Palmer on May 20, 2022.  Weather conditions during the inspection were partly 
cloudy with an ambient temperature at approximately 11 degrees Celsius, and slight winds. The inspection 
involved visual observations of the Phase One Property to confirm current conditions, as well as 
observations of adjacent properties from the Phase One Property limits and publicly accessible locations 
(i.e. municipal roads). Palmer was accompanied by Misha Golubev (CBRE Limited) and Roman Tsap 
(Development Manager of Edenshaw SSR Developments Limited) during a portion of their inspection of 49 
South Service Road. Photographs taken during the Phase One Property inspection are provided in

The Phase One Study Area, as depicted in Figure 1, was surveyed within a 250 m radius and all occupants 
of neighboring properties were noted.  The Phase One Study Area is developed with commercial, 
residential, and institutional land uses, as shown in Figure 3. A construction site was observed to be located 
to the west of the Phase One Property, beside the QEW, as shown in the photographs of Appendix A. 
 
There are no water bodies or areas of natural significance on the Phase One Property.  However, Mary Fix 
Creek exists approximately 230 m south of the Phase One Property in the Phase One Study Area, which 
flows southeastward to Lake Ontario.  
4.3 
Specific Property Observations 
4.3.1 
Structures and Other Improvements 
The Site is developed with a 334-m2, two storey, former OPP detachment building, a 111-m2, single storey 
attached detention area, a 143-m2 garage, and two canopy structures, as shown in Figure 4. The Phase 
One Property is currently unoccupied. 
 
The detachment building (main building) is constructed of masonry walls covered with metal siding, on a 
partial concrete basement foundation and partial concrete slab foundation and covered with a flat modified 
roof, built in 1957. The garage building consists of masonry walls covered with metal siding, on a concrete 
slab foundation and covered with a flat modified roof, built in 1957. 
 
During the site reconnaissance, a levelometer was observed in the boiler room of the basement, which was 
connected to the former fuel oil UST. The owner-provided plans indicated that a 1,000-gallon heating oil 
tank was used to fuel the former boilers within the main building (APEC #4). In addition, recent asphalt 
repair was observed along the east exterior wall of the main building, which is indicative of the UST being 
removed. 
 
ASTs were observed on the Site, including an integrated 50-gallon diesel fuel tank within the backup 
generator, as well as a 1,000 L double-walled water storage tank and associated sump pit located in the 
basement that is no longer in use. No staining or evidence of leaks and/or spills were observed in the vicinity 
of the ASTs. 
4.3.2 
Underground Utilities and Service Corridors 
Underground utilities at the Phase One Property include sanitary sewer, potable water, storm sewer, hydro, 
and natural gas services. One 6” capped port for a potential septic tank was observed at the north portion 
of the Phase One property. Based on the owner-provided legal plan of survey, a concrete septic tank was 
located in this area.  
4.3.3 
Interiors of Structures and Buildings 
The building has four (4) exit and entry points along the north, east, south, and west walls of the main 
structure (detachment building and attached detention area). The garage has three (3) exit and entry points 
along the north, east, and south walls, as well as six (6) overhead garage doors along the east wall. 
 
 
 
Phase One Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)

The buildings are heated by a combination of hot water and forced air heating. Two (2) natural gas fired 
boiler systems are located in the basement of the main building. Electric hot water heaters are located in 
the basement of the main building and in the attached garage.  No evidence of any heating oil storage tanks 
was noted with the exception of the levelometer located in the boiler room which was connected to the 
former heating oil UST (APEC #4). 
 
The electrical room located in the basement included transfer switches, electrical panels, circuit breakers, 
and a main panel. 
 
The buildings are cooled by two (2) rooftop air conditioning units. It has been reported that the refrigerants 
in the cooling units may contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are known as ozone depleting 
substances (ODSs).  No immediate action is required at this time; however, while servicing or removing 
any remaining units, the CFC refrigerants and any ODSs should be recovered by a licensed contractor 
according to relevant ministry guidelines. 
 
An Asbestos Building Materials Reassessment Survey Report was conducted at 49 South Service Road 
by ECOH-exp. This report indicated that asbestos materials were detected within pipe insulation in the OPP 
detachment building and piping insulation within the garage building. Based on the age of the buildings 
(1957), it is likely that additional designated substances may have been used during the construction and 
may remain in areas not renovated. The observed substances were in good condition at the time of Palmer’s 
onsite reconnaissance with the exception of small areas of vinyl floor tiles in poor condition. 
 
Floor drains were noted in the basement of the main building, as well as a trench drain that leads to a catch 
basin in the garage. It has been reported that this trench drain discharges to the municipal sanitary sewer 
system. Two (2) sump pump pits are located in the pump room within the basement. One (1) of the sump 
pits is associated with a storage tank and this system is reported to be used to pump stormwater to the 
municipal storm sewer system. 
 
A de-icing salt-related stain was present on the floor in the attached glass entryway of the main building. 
Ground water monitoring wells were also observed in two (2) locations in the basement of the main building. 
4.3.4 
Exterior Portions of the Phase One Property 
The exterior portion of the Phase One Property has grass covered areas to the north of the building and an 
asphalt-paved parking lot area surrounding the subject buildings. A number of ground water monitoring 
wells and sealed boreholes were observed throughout the exterior of the Phase One Property.  
 
Approximately 95 % of the Phase One Property exterior is landscaped, covered with asphalt, or grass. 
 
Surface water from the property drains overland to catch basins located to the northeast of the Phase One 
Property, towards the municipal stormwater sewer system along South Service Road. 
 
There was evidence of a potential septic tank present in the northern, grassy portion of the Phase One 
Property.

Phase One Conceptual Site Model 
Site Description 
 
The Phase One Property is a 1.09-acre, irregular shaped, parcel of land located on the south side of Queen 
Elizabeth Way, north of the intersection with Hurontario Street in Mississauga, Ontario. Building structures 
on the Site include a 334-m2 two-storey former Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) office building (with a partial 
basement) with a 111-m2 single-storey attached detention area, a 143-m2 garage, and two (2) canopy 
structures. The Phase One Property has been vacant since August 2020.  
 
Historically, the Site was first developed prior to 1952 with a single building on the southern portion of the 
Phase One Property. The Phase One Property was subsequently redeveloped in the early 1960s with the 
current buildings. Tenants of the building have included the OPP. 
 
The remaining parts of the Site comprise an asphalt-paved parking lot and landscaped grassed areas. 
 
Water Bodies / Areas of Natural Significance 
 
There are no water bodies or areas of natural significance on the Phase One Property.  However, Mary Fix 
Creek exists approximately 230 m south of the Phase One Property in the Phase One Study Area, which 
flows southeastward to Lake Ontario. 
 
Drinking Water Wells 
 
There are no drinking water well records for the Phase One Property; however there are two (2) well records 
for the Phase One Property and three (3) well records within a 250 m search radius.  These records relate 
to test holes or observation wells in the vicinity of the Phase One Property.

Underground utilities are expected to be present on the subject property (sanitary sewer, storm sewer, city 
water, natural gas, telephone, electricity) and could potentially act as preferential pathways. 
 
Local surficial geologic mapping of the Mississauga area indicates that sand, gravel, and minor silt and clay 
of glaciolacustrine deposits, underlie the Phase One Property. 
 
The Phase One Property is located approximately 230 m north of Mary Fix Creek, which flows 
southeastward to Lake Ontario. The local hydrogeology is controlled by this waterbody, the underlying 
geology, and the topography, and local ground water flow is expected to be southeastward.  The regional 
ground water flow is also expected to be southeastward towards Lake Ontario. 
 
It is not expected that any uncertainty or absence of information would affect the validity of the Conceptual 
Site Model (CSM).

Conclusions 
6.1 
Whether a Phase Two ESA is Required 
The scope of this Phase One ESA conforms to the general requirements outlined in O.Reg. 153/04 and 
407/19. The objectives of the Phase One ESA were to identify the likelihood of the presence or absence of 
PCAs and their associated APECs and COPC, in support of a development approval application with the 
City of Mississauga. The results of the Phase One ESA are documented in this report and reflect site 
conditions observed at the time of the site reconnaissance.  
 
Based on the information obtained as part of the Phase One ESA, it is concluded that five (5) potentially 
contaminating activities (PCAs) were identified either on the Phase One Property or within the Phase One 
Study Area.  These PCAs were deemed to be contributing to five (5) areas of potential environmental 
concern (APECs) on the Phase One Property. 
 
A Phase Two ESA is recommended to assess subsurface impacts as a result of the aforementioned PCAs 
and APECs.  The scope of the Phase Two ESA should entail the analysis of representative soil and ground 
water samples from the Phase One Property for the contaminants of potential concern identified; including 
PHCs, BTEX, VOCs, Metals, As, Sb, and Se. 
 
In addition, asbestos containing materials were detected within pipe insulation in the OPP detachment 
building and piping insulation within the garage building. Based on the age of the buildings (1957), it is likely 
that additional designated substances may have been used during the construction and may remain in 
areas not renovated. The observed substances were in good condition at the time of Palmer’s onsite 
reconnaissance with the exception of small areas of vinyl floor tiles in poor condition. A Designated 
Substances Survey (DSS) is recommended, which may also be required by the City of Mississauga for 
issuing a demolition permit. 
6.2 
Phase One ESA Alone 
It is concluded that five (5) potentially contaminating activities (PCAs) were identified either on the Phase 
One Property or within the Phase One Study Area.  Therefore, five (5) APECs were identified on the Phase 
One Property and a Phase Two ESA is required.

The information provided in this database was collected by examining various historical documents which aimed to characterize the likely position of 
former waste disposal sites from 1860 to present.  The research initiative behind the creation of this database was to identify those sites that are missing
from the Ontario MOE Waste Disposal Site Inventory, as well as to provide revisions and corrections to the positions and descriptions of sites currently 
listed in the MOE inventory.  In addition to historic waste disposal facilities, the database also identifies certain auto wreckers and scrap yards that have 
been extrapolated from documentary sources.  Please note that the data is not warranted to be complete, exhaustive or authoritative.  The information 
was collected for research purposes only.
Government Publication Date: 1860s-Present 
Aboveground Storage Tanks:

In 2000, the Emergencies program implemented NEES, a reporting system for spills of hazardous substances.  For the most part, this system only 
captured data from the Atlantic Provinces, some from Quebec and Ontario and a portion from British Columbia. Data for Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and the Territories was not captured. However, NEES is also a repository for previous Environment Canada spill datasets.  NEES is 
composed of the historic datasets ' or Trends ' which dates from approximately 1974 to present. NEES Trends is a compilation of historic databases, 
which were merged and includes data from NATES (National Analysis of Trends in Emergencies System), ARTS (Atlantic Regional Trends System), 
and NEES.  In 2001, the Emergencies Program determined that variations in reporting regimes and requirements between federal and provincial 
agencies made national spill reporting and trend analysis difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the department has focused efforts on capturing data 
on spills of substances which fall under its legislative authority only (CEPA and FA). As such, the NEES database will be decommissioned in December

or a waste disposal site operated or used pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Certificate of Approval or a Provisional Certificate of Approval.  
Regulation 347 of the Ontario EPA defines a waste receiving site as any site or facility to which waste is transferred by a waste carrier.  A receiver of 
regulated waste is required to register the waste receiving facility.  This database represents registered receivers of regulated wastes, identified by 
registration number, company name and address, and includes receivers of waste such as: landfills, incinerators, transfer stations, PCB storage sites, 
sludge farms and water pollution control plants.  This information is a summary of all years from 1986 including the most currently available data.

Database Descriptions: This section provides a detailed explanation for each database including: source, information available, time coverage, and
acronyms used. They are listed in alphabetic order.
Detail Report: This is the section of the report which provides the most detail for each individual record. Records are summarized by location, starting
with the project property followed by records in closest proximity.
Distance: The distance value is the distance between plotted points, not necessarily the distance between the sites' boundaries. All values are an
approximation.
Direction:  The direction value is the compass direction of the site in respect to the project property and/or center point of the report.
Elevation: The elevation value is taken from the location at which the records for the site address have been plotted. All values are an approximation.
Source: Google Elevation API.
Executive Summary: This portion of the report is divided into 3 sections:
'Report Summary'- Displays a chart indicating how many records fall on the project property and, within the report search radii.
'Site Report Summary'-Project Property'- This section lists all the records which fall on the project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report'
section.
'Site Report Summary-Surrounding Properties'- This section summarizes all records on adjacent properties, listing them in order of proximity from the
project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report' section.
Map Key: The map key number is assigned according to closest proximity from the project property. Map Key numbers always start at #1. The project
property will always have a map key of '1' if records are available. If there is a number in brackets beside the main number, this will indicate the number
of records on that specific property. If there is no number in brackets, there is only one record for that property.
The symbol and colour used indicates 'elevation': the red inverted triangle will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Lower Elevation', the yellow triangle will dictate
'ERIS Sites with Higher Elevation' and the orange square will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Same Elevation.'
Unplottables: These are records that could not be mapped due to various reasons, including limited geographic information. These records may or
may not be in your study area, and are included as reference.

 Information about Requests for Surveys or Plans and Drawings
Form 2373 Page 2  (Rev. 2021 10) 
Copyright Requirements 
Subsection 27(2)(i) of the Federal Copyright Act provides that the disclosure of a record pursuant to a request made under 
the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act is not a violation of copyright. This means that copies 
of architectural plans, drawings and/or specifications, may be provided in response to a request under the Municipal 
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act unless another exemption applies to the records. Please note that the 
person, to whom the record is provided, is still bound by copyright. 
Owner’s Permission Required 
City of Mississauga policy requires that a requester must be the owner of the property or if not the owner, must provide 
written consent of the owner before a request will be processed. 
Reproduction Fees 
There is a reproduction fee of approximately $2.00-$6.00 per full size sheet. Copying charges of 20 cents apply to letter 
and legal size pages. Fees for search time and preparation may also apply. 
Processing Time 
According to the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, a decision regarding the release of the 
drawings must be made within 30 days. 
Availability of Drawings 
Please note the following about the availability of drawings: 
l Single Family & Semi-Detached: The City only holds drawings for the last 7 years.
l Industrial/Commercial & Multiple Family dwellings are available. However, the City may not have some
drawings for the former municipalities.
Surveys 
Where can I obtain a survey of my property? 
The answer depends on the type of survey plan you need. 
Registered Plans of Subdivision are the plans approved under the Planning Act that create buildable lots that conform with 
zoning. They can be purchased in person from the Land Registry Office, ServiceOntario, 1 Gateway Boulevard, Brampton for 
a nominal fee. Modern subdivision plans will show lot dimensions and survey "monumentation" (bars) but do not show 
buildings or other improvements on the property. 
Reference Plans are essentially plans of survey that are "deposited" in the Land Registry Office and are used to illustrate 
parcels of land, or "parts". The "parts" may or may not represent buildable lots. Similar to Plans of Subdivision, Reference 
Plans will show property dimensions, survey monumentation and may show the location of fences in relation to the bound-
aries but generally do not show buildings or other improvements on the property. Reference Plans can also be purchased 
from the Land Registry Office for a nominal fee. 
The other major class of legal survey plans is the Surveyors Real Property Report, formerly known as a Building Location 
Survey or simply Survey Certificate. These plans show lot dimensions, survey monumentation, buildings, garages, decks, 
pools and other major improvements to the property as well as easements, rights-of-way and other property interests. This 
type of survey is typically sought after by homeowners when fencing or planning improvements on the property. These sur-
vey plans are prepared by an Ontario Land Surveyor under contract with the property owner and copyright is retained by 
the Land Surveyor who performed the survey. Unlike Plans of Subdivision and Reference Plans which are available from the 
Land Registry Office, Surveyors Real Property Reports are not kept on file in any public registry system including the Land 
Registry Office, at the City of Mississauga or anywhere else. If you are aware or suspect that your property was surveyed 
sometime in the past, it is best to contact the Ontario Land Surveyor who performed the survey for further information. 
ServiceOntario 
The ServiceOntario office with the Peel Region Land Registry records is located at 1 Gateway Boulevard, Brampton. Plans of 
Subdivision, Condominium Plans, Reference Plans and land title documents can be obtained in person for a nominal fee. 
More information is available through the Ontario government website (www.onland.ca/ui/). 
Ontario Land Surveyor 
A listing of Ontario Land Surveyors licensed to practice Cadastral (legal) surveys can be found in the Yellow Pages online 
under "Surveyors - Land". 
Association of Ontario Land Surveyors 
For more information about surveys and plans and the Survey profession in general, please contact the Association of 
Ontario Land Surveyors (www.aols.org) in Toronto at 416-491-9020 or 1-800-268-0718.
