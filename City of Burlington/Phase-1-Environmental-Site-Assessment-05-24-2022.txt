EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Pinchin Ltd. (Pinchin) was retained by Summit Industrial Income REIT (Client) to complete a Phase One 
Environmental Site Assessment (Phase One ESA) of the property located at 3399 Appleby Line in 
Burlington, Ontario (hereafter referred to as the Site or Phase One Property). The Phase One Property is 
presently vacant and undeveloped, consisting of agricultural land. 
Pinchin conducted this Phase One ESA in accordance with Part VII and Schedule D of the Province of 
Ontario’s Environmental Protection Act R.S.O. 1990, c. E.19 and Ontario Regulation 153/04: Records of 
Site Condition – Part XV.1 of the Act, as amended (O. Reg. 153/04). The purpose of the Phase One ESA 
was to assess the potential presence of environmental impacts at the Phase One Property due to 
activities at and near the Phase One Property.  
This Phase One ESA was conducted at the request of the Client for the future development of the Phase 
One Property. It is Pinchin’s understanding that the Phase One Property will be developed for industrial 
use. Although the proposed development does not result in a change of land use to a more sensitive land 
use, it is Pinchin’s understanding that the City of Burlington (City) and Region of Halton (Region) require 
the preparation of a Phase One ESA in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 
Conservation and Parks (MECP) as per O. Reg. 153/04 before the development can proceed, with 
reliance to the City / Region required as part of the permitting process.  
The scope of work for this Phase One ESA was consistent with O. Reg. 153/04 in support of filing an 
RSC and was comprised of the following: 
 
A Records Review: Reviewed available current and historical information sources 
pertaining to the Phase One Property and Phase One Study Area including the use of, 
but not limited to, aerial photographs, city directories, Fire Insurance Plans, Property 
Underwriters’ Reports and Property Underwriters’ Plans, chain of title search results, 
historical environmental assessments relevant to the Phase One Property and a 
regulatory data base search. Regulatory agencies were also contacted to identify if any 
records of environmental non-compliance or other information associated with the 
environmental condition of the Phase One Property exists, including searches of MECP 
and Technical Standards and Safety Authority records. 
 
Interviews: Conducted interviews with a Site Representative (see Section 5.0) to 
determine if any current or historical operations have caused a concern with respect to 
the environmental condition of the Phase One Property and the surrounding properties 
within the Phase One Study Area. 
 
Site Reconnaissance: Completed a visual assessment of the Phase One Property and 
the surrounding properties within the Phase One Study Area (from publicly-accessible

areas) including any associated buildings and/or facilities for the purpose of identifying 
the presence of potentially contaminating activities (PCAs). 
 
Evaluation: Evaluated the information gathered from the records review, interviews and 
Site reconnaissance. 
 
Reporting: Prepared a Phase One ESA report.  
 
Submission: Submitted the Phase One ESA report to the Client. 
The Phase One Property consists of the civic address 3399 Appleby Line, Burlington, Ontario which is 
currently owned by Summit (3399 Appleby Line) Ltd. The Phase One Property is located on the northeast 
side of Appleby Line, southeast of Highway 407 and approximately 180 m northwest of Harrison Court in 
the City of Burlington. The current and past land uses of the Phase One Property are summarized in 
Table 1 (all Tables are provided in Appendix A and all appendices are provided in Section 10.0). 
The current and past land uses of the Phase One Property are listed in Table 1. A review of the 
ServiceOntario Parcel Register determined that the Phase One Property was owned by Mikalda Farms 
Limited from 1968 to 2021.  
To the best of Pinchin’s knowledge, no building or structure has been constructed on the Phase One 
Property, based on a review of aerial photographs dated between 1934 and 2021 that showed the Phase 
One Property to be undeveloped, vacant land. No other historical records were available to Pinchin that 
provided information for determining the date of first developed use of the Phase One Property.  
The review of information obtained from historical records, interviews and a Site reconnaissance 
completed by Pinchin for the Phase One ESA did not identify any PCAs at the Phase One Property or 
within the Phase One Study Area outside of the Phase One Property (i.e., off-Site) that are considered to 
result in APECs at Phase One Property. One off-Site PCA was identified but this PCA is not considered 
to result in an APEC at the Phase One Property given its distance from the Phase One Property and its 
downgradient location with respect to the inferred groundwater flow direction at the Phase One Property.  
Based on these findings, nothing was identified that is likely to have resulted in impacts to the soil and 
groundwater at the Phase One Property that would require the completion of a Phase Two ESA. As such, 
it is Pinchin’s opinion that the Phase One Property is suitable for the intended future industrial land use. 
 This Executive Summary is subject to the same standard limitations as contained in the report and must 
be read in conjunction with the entire report. 
This report has been issued without having received a response from a request for information sent to the 
Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. Once a response from this regulatory body 
is received, the information will be incorporated into a revised version of this report. Our conclusions and 
recommendations may be amended based on this information.

INTRODUCTION 
A Phase One ESA is defined as a systematic qualitative process to determine whether a particular 
property is, or may be subject to, actual or potential contamination. Under the Province of Ontario’s 
Environmental Protection Act R.S.O. 1990, c. E.19 (EPA) and Ontario Regulation 153/04: Records of Site 
Condition – Part XV.1 of the Act, as amended (O. Reg. 153/04), the purpose of a Phase One ESA is two-
fold: 
 
To obtain and review records that relate to the Phase One Property, and to the current 
and past uses of and activities at or affecting the Phase One Property, in order to 
determine if an area of potential environmental concern (APEC) exists and to interpret 
any APEC; and 
 
To obtain and review records that relate to properties in the Phase One Study Area, other 
than the Phase One Property, in order to determine if a potentially contaminating activity 
(PCA) exists and interpret whether any such PCA results in an APEC at the Phase One 
Property. 
This Phase One ESA was conducted at the request of the Client for the future development of the Phase 
One Property. It is Pinchin’s understanding that the Phase One Property will be developed for industrial 
use. Although the proposed development does not result in a change of land use to a more sensitive land 
use, it is Pinchin’s understanding that the City of Burlington (City) and Region of Halton (Region) require 
the preparation of a Phase One ESA in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 
Conservation and Parks (MECP) as per O. Reg. 153/04 before the development can proceed, with 
reliance to the City / Region required as part of the permitting process.  
A Phase One ESA does not include sampling or testing of environmental media or building materials. The 
study period for this assessment was from April to May 2022, which included the records review, Site 
reconnaissance, interviews and reporting.  
2.1 
Phase One Property Information 
The Phase One Property consists of the civic address 3399 Appleby Line, Burlington, Ontario which is

RECORDS REVIEW 
4.1 
General 
Identified off-Site PCAs described in this and subsequent report Sections are summarized in Table 2 and 
their locations are shown on Figure 4. 
Each on-Site PCA is associated with an APEC at the Phase One Property. Each off-Site PCA was 
characterized as to whether it resulted in an APEC at the Phase One Property. In making this 
determination, the proximity, location relative to the inferred groundwater flow direction, nature of 
operations and potential contaminants were considered. In general, PCAs that were relatively close to the 
Phase One Property and/or were at properties upgradient of the Phase One Property with respect to the 
inferred groundwater flow direction were considered PCAs resulting in APECs. Conversely, PCAs that 
were distant from the Phase One Property and/or were at properties downgradient or transgradient of the 
Phase One Property with respect to the inferred groundwater flow direction were not considered PCAs 
resulting in APECs. The type of operations and potential contaminants associated with the PCAs were 
also evaluated. Factors such as whether the PCA had a high probability of contamination (e.g., dry 
cleaners, retail fuel outlets (RFOs), automotive service garages, etc.) and mobility of the potential 
contaminants in the subsurface were considered during the evaluation. 
4.1.1 
Phase One Study Area Determination 
Based on a review of the available historical information and observations made during the Site 
reconnaissance for the properties greater than 250 metres (m), but less than 1 kilometre (km), from the 
Phase One Property boundary, Pinchin did not note or observe any significant potentially contaminating 
properties that should be included as part of this assessment (e.g., landfills, large industrial

manufacturers, etc.). As such, the Phase One Study Area consisted of the Phase One Property, as well 
as all properties situated wholly, or partly, within 250 m from the nearest point of a boundary of the Phase 
One Property, in order to meet the minimum requirements set forth in O. Reg. 153/04.  
4.1.2 
First Developed Use Determination 
The first developed land use of the Phase One Property is defined by O. Reg. 153/04 to be the earlier of: 
 
The first use of a Phase One Property in or after 1875 that resulted in the development of 
a building or structure on the property; and 
 
The first potentially contaminating use or activity on the Phase One Property.  
A review of the ServiceOntario Parcel Register determined that the Phase One Property was owned by 
Mikalda Farms Limited from 1968 to 2021.  
To the best of Pinchin’s knowledge, no building or structure has been constructed on the Phase One 
Property, based on a review of aerial photographs dated between 1934 and 2021 that showed the Phase 
One Property to be undeveloped, vacant land.  
4.1.3 
Fire Insurance Plans 
Pinchin contacted Opta Information Intelligence (Opta) to obtain FIPs related to the Phase One Property 
and the Phase One Study Area. A response was received from Opta dated April 20, 2022, which 
indicated that no FIPs for the Phase One Property and Phase One Study Area were available. The Opta 
response is provided in Appendix E. 
4.1.4 
Chain of Title  
A chain of title search was not completed for the Phase One ESA. The available historical records 
reviewed by Pinchin included aerial photographs from 1934 to 2021, and city directories for various years 
between 1959 and 2013. These records indicate that the Phase One Property has never been developed 
and it was Pinchin’s opinion that a chain of title search would not provide any additional information 
regarding the environmental condition of the Phase One Property.  
4.1.5 
Environmental Reports 
The following previous environmental reports for the Phase One Property, as provided by the Client, were 
reviewed by Pinchin: 
 
“Phase Two Environmental Site Assessment, 3399 Appleby Line, Burlington, Ontario” 
prepared for Appleby 407 Limited Partnership by its general partner, Appleby 407 Inc., by 
GHD Limited (GHD), and dated July 9, 2021 (2021 GHD Phase Two ESA); and

 
“Geotechnical Investigation for Proposed Industrial Development, 3399 Appleby Line, 
Burlington, Ontario” prepared by J.T. Donald Consultants Limited (Donald) and dated 
August 11, 2021 (2021 Donald Geotechnical Investigation).  
Pinchin reviewed the available analytical data provided in the above-referenced reports to assess 
whether there are any known soil and groundwater impacts at the Phase One Property.  
Given the available information on the characteristics of the Phase One Property, its future land use (i.e., 
industrial), and its proximity to an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) (refer to Section 4.3.4 of 
this report), the applicable Site Condition Standards, as defined by the MECP in the document “Soil, 
Ground Water and Sediment Standards for Use Under Part XV.1 of the Environmental Protection Act”, 
dated April 15, 2011, are: 
 
Table 1: Full Depth Background Site Condition Standards (Table 1 Standards) for 
residential / parkland / institutional / industrial / commercial / community property use (i.e., 
the proposed future use of the Phase One Property) and fine-textured soils. 
As such, the analytical data provided in the previous reports were compared with the Table 1 Standards 
to assess whether there are any known areas on the Phase One Property or in the Phase One Study 
Area where soil or groundwater has parameter concentrations exceeding the Table 1 Standards. 
A summary of the salient information identified in the reports is provided below. 
2021 GHD Phase Two ESA 
The GHD Phase Two ESA was completed following a Phase One ESA completed by GHD in May 2021. 
A copy of the GHD Phase One ESA was not available for Pinchin’s review.  It was reported that the 
Phase One ESA identified an on-Site PCA in the application of pesticides (PCA #40 – Pesticides 
(including Herbicides, Fungicides, and Anti-Fouling Agents) Manufacturing, Bulk Storage and Large-Scale 
Applications). This on-Site PCA resulted in an APEC at the Phase One Property. It is unclear if GHD 
reviewed records that indicated that pesticides were applied to the Site or if this PCA was assumed given 
its use.  
To assess this APEC, GHD advanced four (4) shallow boreholes across the Site using a hand auger. The 
boreholes were advanced to 0.15 mbgs. Soil samples were collected from the boreholes and submitted 
for laboratory analysis of metals, organochlorine pesticides (OCP), pH and/or grain size.  
The grain size analysis from three (3) submitted samples indicated that the soil was fine-textured (81%, 
83% and 81%). The pH values were also within the required range (>5 to <9) for surface soil (6.30, 6.20 
and 6.10). The concentrations of metals and OCP in the submitted soil samples met the Table 1 
Standards.

The 2021 Donald Geotechnical Investigation consisted of the advancement of thirteen boreholes at the 
Phase One Property. The subsurface conditions at the Site consisted of topsoil and disturbed native soils 
followed by glacial till (sandy silt to silt) to the maximum borehole depth of 7 mbgs. Groundwater was 
encountered at 4.3 and 5.8 mbgs in two of the boreholes; however, no monitoring wells were installed as 
part of this geotechnical investigation.  
4.1.5.1 Previous Environmental Report Summary  
Based on Pinchin’s review of the above-referenced previous environmental reports, it is Pinchin’s opinion 
that the PCA identified by GHD has been adequately assessed and that it no longer represents an APEC 
at the Site. Furthermore, no additional PCAs were identified within the Phase One Study Area. 
4.2 
Environmental Source Information  
Pinchin reviewed the historical use of the Phase One Study Area through the use of publicly available 
archives and databases, as well as through requesting information from regulatory agencies. The 
following provides a summary of the information obtained from these sources. 
4.2.1 
 Environmental Database Search – ERIS 
Pinchin retained Environmental Risk Information Services (ERIS) to search all available federal, provincial 
and private source databases for information pertaining to the Phase One Study Area. Unless otherwise 
noted, information obtained from the ERIS database search was reviewed for the entire Phase One Study 
Area. A copy of the ERIS report is provided in Appendix G and the results of the database search are 
described in the following sections. 
4.2.1.1 National Pollutant Release Inventory 
ERIS completed a search of the federal databases for information regarding the National Pollutant 
Release Inventory (NPRI). This database contains comprehensive national data regarding releases to air, 
water, or land, and waste transfers for recycling for more than 300 listed substances and identifies 
information such as the approximate location, type and quantity of contaminant, date of release, and 
media impacted. 
Pinchin reviewed the ERIS report for NPRI information and found no records regarding the Phase One 
Study Area.  
4.2.1.2 Ontario Inventory of PCB Storage Sites 
The MECP’s Waste Management Branch maintains an inventory of PCB storage sites within Ontario. 
Ontario Regulation 11/82 and Ontario Regulation 347 (O. Reg. 347), made under the EPA, require the 
registration of inactive PCB storage equipment and/or disposal sites of PCB waste with the MECP. This

database contains information on waste quantities, major and minor sites storing liquid or solid waste, 
and a waste storage inventory.  
ERIS completed a search of the Ontario Inventory of PCB Storage Sites for information regarding PCB 
storage and found no information regarding the Phase One Study Area.  
4.2.1.3 National PCB Inventory 
Environment Canada maintains an inventory of in-use PCB-containing equipment at federal, provincial 
and private facilities in Canada, and of out-of-service PCB-containing equipment and PCB waste owned 
by the federal government or federally regulated industries. 
ERIS completed a search of the National PCB Inventory and found no information regarding the Phase 
One Study Area.  
4.2.1.4 Certificates of Approval 
ERIS completed a search of the MECP database for information regarding Certificates of Approval (Cs-of-
A). The MECP maintains a database of approved Cs-of-A for Air & Noise, Industrial Sewage, Municipal & 
Private Sewage, Waste Management Systems and Renewable Energy Approvals. Prior to November 1, 
2011, the MECP mandated that any facility that released emissions to the atmosphere, discharged 
contaminants to ground or surface water, provided potable water supplies, or stored, transported or 
disposed of waste, must have a C-of-A before it could operate lawfully. The MECP no longer issues Cs-
of-A, which were replaced by Environmental Compliance Approvals (ECAs) as of November 1, 2011. O. 
Reg. 153/04 indicates that information from the C-of-A database only needs to be obtained for the Phase 
One Property and properties adjacent to the Phase One Property. 
The ERIS search of the C-of-A database identified no information regarding Cs-of-A for the Phase One 
Property or for properties adjacent to the Phase One Property.  
4.2.1.5 Environmental Compliance Approvals, Permits To Take Water and Certificates of Property Use 
ERIS completed a search of the MECP database for information regarding ECAs, permits including 
Permits To Take Water (PTTWs) and Certificates of Property Use (CPUs). O. Reg. 153/04 indicates that 
information from these databases only needs to be obtained for the Phase One Property and properties 
adjacent to the Phase One Property. Details regarding these databases are provided in the ERIS report in 
Appendix G. 
The ERIS database search identified no information regarding ECAs, PTTWs or CPUs for the Phase One 
Property and properties adjacent to the Phase One Property.

the Phase One Property and properties adjacent to the Phase One Property. 
4.2.1.8 Waste Management Records 
Waste Generators 
ERIS completed a search of the O. Reg. 347 Waste Generators database for information regarding waste 
generation. O. Reg. 347 defines a waste generation site as any site, equipment and/or operation involved 
in the production, collection, handling and/or storage of regulated wastes. A generator of regulated waste 
is required to register the waste generation site and each waste produced, collected, handled or stored at 
the site. This database contains the registration number, company name and address of registered 
generators including the types of hazardous wastes generated. It includes data on waste generating 
facilities such as drycleaners, waste treatment and disposal facilities, machine shops, electric power 
distribution, etc. The database search results provide a summary of available waste generation 
information for the registered sites for all years from 1986 to the present.  
O. Reg. 153/04 indicates that information from the Waste Generator database only needs to be obtained 
for the Phase One Property and properties adjacent to the Phase One Property. However, in addition to 
the Phase One Property and adjacent off-Site properties, Pinchin reviewed the database for waste 
generators within 50 m transgradient and 100 m upgradient of the Phase One Property with respect to the

Physical Setting Sources 
4.3.1 
Aerial Photographs  
Pinchin reviewed aerial photographs of the Phase One Property and surrounding properties within the 
Phase One Study Area to assess the potential for historical PCAs. Copies of aerial photographs dated 
1934, 1954, 1965, 1974, and 1985 were obtained from the National Air Photo Library in Ottawa, Ontario 
and reviewed by Pinchin. In addition, Pinchin reviewed satellite images provided by the City of Burlington 
GIS website (https://burlington.maps.arcgis.com/ ) dated 2002, 2012, 2017 and 2021. The 1934 aerial 
photograph was the earliest available aerial photograph of the Phase One Study Area. 
Efforts were made by Pinchin to obtain aerial photographs that: 
 
Illustrated the period between initial development of the Phase One Property to the 
present. 
 
Identified buildings and structures present on the Phase One Property since initial 
development. 
 
Identified PCAs within the Phase One Study Area. 
 
Identified APECs on the Phase One Property. 
It should be noted that accurate details could not be determined from some of the aerial photographs due 
to the reference scale and the resolution of the photographs.  
A summary of information obtained with respect to the Phase One Property from a review of the available 
aerial photography is provided in the following table:

Based on the aerial photographs reviewed for the Phase One Property and the surrounding area, it 
appears that the Phase One Property remained undeveloped from 1934 to 2021.  
The aerial photograph review did not identify any PCAs within the Phase One Study Area, including the 
Phase One Property. Copies of the aerial photographs of the Phase One Property and surrounding area 
are provided in Appendix J. 
4.3.2 
Topography, Hydrology and Geology 
The elevation of the Phase One Property, based on information obtained from the Ontario Base Map 
series, is ranges from 160 to 165 m above mean sea level (mamsl). The general topography in the local 
and surrounding areas is generally flat with a downward slope towards Bronte Creek. No bedrock 
outcrops were observed on-Site or in the surrounding area. Based on data from the Ontario Geological 
Survey, the overburden thickness on-Site (i.e., depth to bedrock) is approximately 28 m.  
A review of the available physiographical data indicates that the Phase One Property and the surrounding 
properties located within the Phase One Study Area are located within the till morraines as the dominant 
landform with the primary native material consisting of silt till. Bedrock is expected to consist of shale, 
limestone, dolostone and siltstone of the Queenston Formation at an elevation of 132 mamsl. The 
topography is considered to be mainly flat to rolling low local relief with dry surface water drainage 
conditions. During previous on-Site environmental investigations, the soil stratigraphy was observed to 
consist of topsoil and disturbed native soils followed by glacial till (sandy silt to silt) to the maximum 
borehole depth of 7 mbgs. 
Based on general hydrogeological principles and Pinchin’s familiarity with subsurface conditions at and 
near the Phase One Property and the surrounding properties within the Phase One Study Area, the 
unconfined groundwater beneath the Phase One Property is expected to flow in a southeasterly to 
easterly direction. Bronte Creek is located approximately 75 m northeast of the Site and flows southeast 
towards Lake Ontario, located approximately 8.5 km southeast of the Site.  
Copies of pertinent maps, illustrating local topographical, hydrogeological and drainage features are 
provided in Appendix K. 
4.3.3 
Fill Materials  
The historical records review provided no information regarding the presence of fill material at the Phase 
One Property. 
Although the Phase One ESA did not identify any historical or current fill material at the Phase One 
Property, potential future development plans should incorporate the appropriate procedures for the 
characterization of soils that may require off-Site disposal. Further assessment and/or costs may be 
incurred through re-development of the Phase One Property and/or change in land use scenarios.

Water Bodies, Areas of Natural Significance and Groundwater Information 
No water bodies were identified on the Phase One Property. Bronte Creek was located approximately 
75 m northeast of the Phase One Property and flowed southeast towards Lake Ontario.  
The Area of Natural & Scientific Interest map prepared by ERIS (see Appendix G) and information 
provided on the MNRF’s NHIC website identified the following areas of natural significance within the 
Phase One Study Area: 
 
Zimmerman Valley (a Life Science ANSI) is located adjacent to the northeast of the 
Phase One Property.  
 
Bronte Creek is located approximately 75 m northeast of the Site.  
A review of the Halton Region Sourcewater Protection mapping indicated that the Phase One Study Area 
is not located in whole or in part within a well head protection area or other designation identified by the 
City or Region for the protection of groundwater. 
Based on information provided in the Halton Region Sourcewater Protection mapping, all other properties 
within the Phase One Study Area are serviced by a municipal drinking water system, with Lake Ontario 
serving as the source.  
The records review did not identify the presence of wells within the Phase One Property or within the 
Phase One Study Area that currently supply water for human consumption or for agricultural purposes. 
4.3.5 
Well Records  
The Water Well Information System database search did not identify any water well records for the Phase 
One Property but did identify 1 water well record within the Phase One Study Area outside of the Phase 
One Property. Details regarding this off-Site well, including stratigraphic information, depth to bedrock 
and/or depth to the water table, are provided in the ERIS report included in Appendix G.

Pinchin observed 1 PCA at the time of the Site reconnaissance within the Phase One Study Area. This 
additional PCA is summarized in Table 2. 
6.3 
Enhanced Investigation Property 
O. Reg. 153/04 defines an “Enhanced Investigation Property” as a property that is being used or has 
been used, in whole or in part, in the following manner:  
 
For an industrial use or; 
 
For any of the following commercial uses: 
 
As a garage; 
 
As a bulk liquid dispensing facility, including a gasoline outlet; or 
 
For the operation of dry cleaning equipment.  
The findings of this Phase One ESA have not documented any of the above land uses as occurring at the 
Phase One Property, and the Phase One Property is therefore not an Enhanced Investigation Property. 
6.4 
Written Description of Investigation 
The Phase One ESA completed by Pinchin included investigations of the Phase One Property and the 
Phase One Study Area outside of the Phase One Property pursuant to Sections 13 and 14 of Schedule D 
of O. Reg.153/04. The main objective of these investigations was to identify PCAs at the Phase One 
Property or within the Phase One Study Area outside of the Phase One Property that could have resulted 
in APECs at the Phase One Property. 
6.4.1 
Phase One Property 
The investigation of the Phase One Property consisted of the following components: 
 
Review of available historical records, including previous environmental reports, ERIS 
regulatory search, information obtained through MECP FOI and TSSA requests, city 
directories, aerial photographs, and well records.

 
A Site reconnaissance completed on April 26, 2022 by Pinchin that included an 
assessment of the Phase One Property. 
 
Interviews with individuals knowledgeable of the history and operations at the Phase One 
Property. 
 
Review of mapping provided by ERIS and information provided on-line by the MNRF for 
the presence of areas of natural significance. 
Pinchin’s investigation of the Phase One Property did not identify any PCAs. 
No areas of natural significance were identified at the Phase One Property. 
Pinchin’s investigation did not identify the presence of wells at the Phase One Property that currently 
supply water for human consumption or for agricultural purposes.  
6.4.2 
Phase One Study Area Outside of Phase One Property 
The investigation of the Phase One Study Area outside of the Phase One Property consisted of the 
following components: 
 
Review of available historical records, including ERIS regulatory search, city directories 
and aerial photographs. 
 
Visual inspection of properties from publicly-accessible areas for evidence of PCAs and 
water bodies. 
 
Review of mapping provided by ERIS and information provided on-line by the MNRF for 
the presence of areas of natural significance. 
Pinchin’s investigation of the Phase One Study Area outside of the Phase One Property identified one (1) 
PCA within the Phase One Study Area outside of the Phase One Property. This PCA is not considered to 
result in an APEC at the Phase One Property given the distance from the PCA to the Phase One 
Property, and the downgradient or transgradient locations relative to the inferred groundwater flow 
direction in the Phase One Study Area. The descriptions and locations of this PCA is provided in Table 2. 
The following areas of natural significance were identified within the Phase One Study Area outside the 
Phase One Property: 
 
Zimmerman Valley (a Life Science ANSI) is located adjacent to the northeast of the 
Phase One Property.  
 
Bronte Creek is located approximately 75 m northeast of the Site.  
Pinchin’s investigation did not identify the presence of wells within the Phase One Study Area that 
currently supply water for human consumption or for agricultural purposes.

Based on a cursory review of the properties greater than 250 m (i.e., outside of the Phase One Study 
Area), but less than 1 km, from the Phase One Study Area, Pinchin did not note or observe any 
significant contaminating properties that should be included as part of this assessment (i.e., landfills, large 
industrial manufacturers, etc.). 
Plans identifying the locations of the off-Site PCAs are provided as Figure 4. The identified areas of 
natural significance are shown on the Area of Natural & Scientific Interest map included in the ERIS 
report in Appendix K. 
7.0 
REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 
7.1 
Current and Past Uses 
The current and past land uses of the Phase One Property are listed in Table 1. A review of the 
ServiceOntario Parcel Register determined that the Phase One Property was owned by Mikalda Farms 
Limited from 1968 to 2021.  
To the best of Pinchin’s knowledge, no building or structure has been constructed on the Phase One 
Property, based on a review of aerial photographs dated between 1934 and 2021 that showed the Phase 
One Property to be undeveloped, vacant land. No other historical records were available to Pinchin that 
provided information for determining the date of first developed use of the Phase One Property.  
7.2 
Potentially Contaminating Activities 
Table 2 summarizes the descriptions and locations of all PCAs as defined by O. Reg. 153/04 that were 
identified by Pinchin within the Phase One Study Area. The following presents a summary of these PCAs: 
 
No PCAs were documented to have occurred at the Phase One Property. 
 
The one off-Site PCA is not considered to result in an APEC at the Phase One Property 
given the distance from the PCA to the Phase One Property and its downgradient 
location relative to the inferred groundwater flow direction in the Phase One Study Area.  
7.3 
Areas of Potential Environmental Concern 
No APECs as defined by O. Reg. 153/04 were identified by Pinchin at the Phase One Property.  
The rationale used by the QP in assessing the available information to determine whether PCAs exist or 
have existed within the Phase One Study Area, including the Phase One Property, that represent an 
APEC at the Phase One Property has been provided in the preceding report sections. In general, the 
potential for environmental impacts to the Phase One Property was evaluated using a combined 
probability for a source to contaminate, and the ability of contaminants to migrate on, or to the Phase One 
Property. For example, a gasoline UST located on the Phase One Property, or on a property in close

proximity and/or upgradient of the Phase One Property, would exhibit a high potential for contamination 
(and is therefore considered a PCA resulting in an APEC at the Phase One Property) since gasoline is 
highly mobile in the subsurface. In contrast, shallow soil/fill with metals impacts located on a property 
adjacent to the Phase One Property would be considered to have a low potential for contamination given 
that metals generally have low mobility in the subsurface (and would not be considered a PCA resulting in 
an APEC at the Phase One Property). Furthermore, non-adjacent properties with PCAs located 
downgradient or transgradient of the Phase One Property generally do not result in APECs at the Phase 
One Property. Groundwater is the media through which contaminants typically migrate from property to 
property, and if the source of the contaminant is downgradient or transgradient of the Phase One 
Property, contaminated groundwater from this source cannot migrate to the Phase One Property and the 
downgradient or transgradient PCA would not be considered to result in an APEC at the Phase One 
Property. 
The evaluation of the presence/absence of APECs at the Phase One Property was based upon the 
analysis of available documents, records and drawings, and personal interviews. In evaluating the Phase 
One Property and Phase One Study Area, Pinchin has relied in good faith on information provided by 
other individuals or sources as noted in this report. Pinchin has assumed that the information provided is 
factual and accurate, and has no reason to believe that any of the information provided in the available 
documentation or obtained through interviews is not factual or inaccurate.  
Pinchin is not aware of any additional information that would alter the conclusions regarding the 
presence/absence of APECs at the Phase One Property. 
7.4 
Phase One Conceptual Site Model 
A conceptual site model (CSM) has been created to provide a summary of the findings of the Phase One 
ESA. The Phase One CSM is summarized in Figures 1 through Figure 4 which illustrate the following 
features within the Phase One Study Area, where present: 
 
Existing buildings and structures. 
 
Water bodies located in whole or in part within the Phase One Study Area. 
 
Areas of natural significance located in whole or in part within the Phase One Study Area. 
 
Drinking water wells located at the Phase One Property. 
 
Land use of adjacent properties. 
 
Roads within the Phase One Study Area. 
 
PCAs within the Phase One Study Area, including the locations of tanks. 
 
APECs at the Phase One Property.

The following provides a narrative summary of the Phase One CSM: 
 
The Phase One Property is an irregularly-shaped parcel of land approximately 4.76 acres 
(11.76 hectares) in area located on the northeast side of Appleby Line, southeast of 
Highway 407 and approximately 180 m northwest of Harrison Court in the City of 
Burlington. The Phase One Property consists of undeveloped, vacant land which has 
never been developed. There is no record of industrial use or of a commercial use (e.g., 
garage, bulk liquid dispensing facility or dry cleaner) that would require classifying the 
Phase One Property as an Enhanced Investigation Property.  
 
Bronte Creek is located approximately 75 m northeast of the Site and flows southeast 
towards Lake Ontario, located approximately 8.5 km southeast of the Site.  
 
One area of natural and scientific interest (ANSI) was identified within the Phase One 
Study Area, identified as Zimmerman Valley, a life science ANSI located adjacent to the 
northeast of the Phase One Property. 
 
No drinking water wells were located on the Phase One Property.  
 
Highway 407 is located adjacent to the northwest of the Phase One Property and 
Appleby Line is located adjacent to the southwest of the Phase One Property. Appleby 
Pumping Station and Zimmerman Valley ANSI are located adjacent to the northeast of 
the Phase One Property. The adjacent property to the southeast of the Phase One 
Property is undeveloped, vacant land. The historical information shows no records of any 
PCAs at the adjacent properties. 
 
No PCAs were identified at the Phase One Property and one PCA was identified within 
the Phase One Study Area, outside of the Phase One Property. As shown on Figure 4, 
the off-Site PCA is a downgradient automotive servicing operation located at 3253 
Appleby Line, approximately 210 m southeast of the Phase One Property and situated 
hydraulically downgradient. Given that the distance of this PCA and downgradient 
location relative to the Phase One Property, the off-Site PCA is not considered to result in 
an APEC at the Phase One Property. COPCs associated with the off-Site PCAs are not a 
concern to the Phase One Property because there are no APECs at the Phase One 
Property. 
 
The Phase One Property has remained undeveloped and there are no known 
underground utilities. 
 
The Phase One Property and the surrounding properties located within the Phase One 
Study Area are located within till morraines as the dominant landform with the primary 
native material consisting of silt till. Bedrock is expected to consist of shale, limestone,

dolostone and siltstone of the Queenston Formation at a depth of approximately 28 
mbgs. During previous on-Site environmental investigations, the soil stratigraphy was 
observed to consist of topsoil and disturbed native soils followed by glacial till (sandy silt 
to silt) to the maximum borehole depth of 7 mbgs. 
 
The Phase One Property is relatively flat with a downward slope towards Bronte Creek. 
Local groundwater flow is inferred to be to the southeast to east, based on the 
topography of the area surrounding the Phase One Property and the location of Bronte 
Creek. Regional groundwater flow is inferred to be to the southeast towards Lake 
Ontario, located approximately 8.5 km southeast of the Site.  
There were no deviations from the Phase One ESA requirements specified in O. Reg. 153/04 or absence 
of information that have resulted in uncertainty that would affect the validity of the Phase One CSM. 
8.0 
CONCLUSIONS  
Pinchin conducted this Phase One ESA in accordance with Part VII and Schedule D of O. Reg. 153/04. 
The purpose of the Phase One ESA was to assess the potential presence of environmental impacts at 
the Phase One Property due to activities at and near the Phase One Property in support of Site Plan 
Approval in accordance with O. Reg. 153/04.  
The review of information obtained from historical records, interviews and a Site reconnaissance 
completed by Pinchin for the Phase One ESA did not identify any PCAs at the Phase One Property or 
within the Phase One Study Area outside of the Phase One Property (i.e., off-Site) that are considered to 
result in APECs at Phase One Property. One off-Site PCA was identified but this PCA is not considered 
to result in APECs at the Phase One Property given its distance from the Phase One Property and its 
downgradient location with respect to the inferred groundwater flow direction at the Phase One Property.  
Based on these findings, nothing was identified that is likely to have resulted in impacts to the soil and 
groundwater at the Phase One Property that would require the completion of a Phase Two ESA. As such, 
it is Pinchin’s opinion that the Phase One Property is suitable for the intended future industrial land use. 
It should be noted that the references and sources for the information used in evaluating the Phase One 
Property are provided in the relevant sections of this report. Specific references are also summarized in 
Section 9.0.

Environmental Activity and Sector Registry:
Provincial
rr-EASR-bb
On October 31, 2011, a smarter, faster environmental approvals system came into effect in Ontario.  The EASR allows businesses to register certain 
activities with the ministry, rather than apply for an approval. The registry is available for common systems and processes, to which preset rules of 
operation can be applied.  The EASR is currently available for:  heating systems, standby power systems and automotive refinishing. Businesses whose
activities aren't subject to the EASR may apply for an ECA (Environmental Compliance Approval), Please see our ECA database.

local business is requesting a permit, license, or certificate of approval to release substances into the air or water; these are notified on the registry. Data
includes: Approval for discharge into the natural environment other than water (i.e. Air) - EPA s. 9, Approval for sewage works - OWRA s. 53(1), and 
EPA s. 27 - Approval for a waste disposal site.  For information regarding Permit to Take Water (PTTW), Certificate of Property Use (CPU) and (ORD) 
Orders please refer to those individual databases.
Government Publication Date: 1994 - Mar 31, 2022 
Environmental Compliance Approval:
Provincial
rr-ECA-bb
On October 31, 2011, a smarter, faster environmental approvals system came into effect in Ontario. In the past, a business had to apply for multiple 
approvals (known as certificates of approval) for individual processes and pieces of equipment. Today, a business either registers itself, or applies for a 
single approval, depending on the types of activities it conducts. Businesses whose activities aren't subject to the EASR may apply for an ECA. A single 
ECA addresses all of a business's emissions, discharges and wastes. Separate approvals for air, noise and waste are no longer required. This database
will also include Renewable Energy Approvals. For certificates of approval prior to Nov 1st, 2011, please refer to the CA database.  For all Waste 
Disposal Sites please refer to the WDS database.

In the early 70's, the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines created an inventory of approximately 19,000 mineral occurrences in Ontario, in 
regard to metallic and industrial minerals, as well as some information on building stones and aggregate deposits.  Please note that the "Horizontal 
Positional Accuracy" is approximately +/- 200 m.  Many reference elements for each record were derived from field sketches using pace or chain/tape 
measurements against claim posts or topographic features in the area.  The primary limiting factor for the level of positional accuracy is the scale of the 
source material. The testing of horizontal accuracy of the source materials was accomplished by comparing the plan metric (X and Y) coordinates of that
point with the coordinates of the same point as defined from a source of higher accuracy.

National Environmental Emergencies System (NEES):

rr-NEES-bb
In 2000, the Emergencies program implemented NEES, a reporting system for spills of hazardous substances.  For the most part, this system only 
captured data from the Atlantic Provinces, some from Quebec and Ontario and a portion from British Columbia. Data for Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and the Territories was not captured. However, NEES is also a repository for previous Environment Canada spill datasets.  NEES is 
composed of the historic datasets ' or Trends ' which dates from approximately 1974 to present. NEES Trends is a compilation of historic databases, 
which were merged and includes data from NATES (National Analysis of Trends in Emergencies System), ARTS (Atlantic Regional Trends System), 
and NEES.  In 2001, the Emergencies Program determined that variations in reporting regimes and requirements between federal and provincial 
agencies made national spill reporting and trend analysis difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the department has focused efforts on capturing data 
on spills of substances which fall under its legislative authority only (CEPA and FA). As such, the NEES database will be decommissioned in December 
2004.

Direction:  The direction value is the compass direction of the site in respect to the project property and/or center point of the report.
Elevation: The elevation value is taken from the location at which the records for the site address have been plotted. All values are an approximation.
Source: Google Elevation API.
Executive Summary: This portion of the report is divided into 3 sections:
'Report Summary'- Displays a chart indicating how many records fall on the project property and, within the report search radii.
'Site Report Summary'-Project Property'- This section lists all the records which fall on the project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report'
section.
'Site Report Summary-Surrounding Properties'- This section summarizes all records on adjacent properties, listing them in order of proximity from the
project property. For more details, see the 'Detail Report' section.
Map Key: The map key number is assigned according to closest proximity from the project property. Map Key numbers always start at #1. The project
property will always have a map key of '1' if records are available. If there is a number in brackets beside the main number, this will indicate the number
of records on that specific property. If there is no number in brackets, there is only one record for that property.
The symbol and colour used indicates 'elevation': the red inverted triangle will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Lower Elevation', the yellow triangle will dictate
'ERIS Sites with Higher Elevation' and the orange square will dictate 'ERIS Sites with Same Elevation.'
Unplottables: These are records that could not be mapped due to various reasons, including limited geographic information. These records may or
may not be in your study area, and are included as reference.

Limitations and Notices: 
TSSA Fuels Safety: 
If you have environmental concerns regarding this property, you should consider hiring an 
environmental consultant to conduct an environmental assessment of the property in question. 
▪ Sites that have not been licensed since 1987 may not be in TSSA records. 
▪ Be advised, TSSA Fuels Safety Division did not register: 
• 
private fuel underground/ aboveground storage tanks prior to January of 1990; and 
•  furnace oil tanks prior to May 1, 2002.  
 
▪ Fuels Safety Division does not register  
• 
private waste oil tanks in apartments, office buildings, residences etc.; and 
• 
aboveground gas or diesel tanks. 
 
▪ The Technical Standards and Safety Act and associated regulations do not require the 
registration of private fuel outlets, nor does it require that any documentation on these facilities be 
submitted to or reviewed or approved by TSSA.  As a result, TSSA has limited information on 
these facilities.  TSSA cautions that any information provided may be inaccurate, incomplete or 
out of date. 
TSSA Elevating & Amusement Devices Program Notice: 
▪ All orders and/or directions issued by the TSSA Inspector have a compliance date and the owner or 
designated contractor are required to comply within the specified time limit.  
▪ All written declarations of compliance (where eligible) should be sent to TSSA. Once a declaration of 
compliance has been received, the outstanding order will be resolved. 
▪ Each report shows the details and date of the inspection conducted by TSSA at the requested 
location. 
▪ The Ontario Amusement Devices Regulation (O. Reg. 221/01) was adopted in 2001. Since that time, 
TSSA retains copies of technical dossiers of new amusement devices in Ontario (as per TSSA’s 
retention policy). However, for rides that existed prior to the adoption of the Regulation, which were 
subject to a “grandfathering-in” clause, technical dossiers were not required to be filed with the TSSA. 
However, if the amusement ride remains in operation, as per ASTM requirements, the owner/licensee 
must possess an operations document for the device in question. 
TSSA Boilers and Pressure Vessels (BPVs) Program Notice: 
▪ Be advised, TSSA does not typically inspect BPVs. These inspections are usually performed by 
insurance companies.  
▪ **Inspection reports are not always submitted to TSSA by insurance companies; therefore, while 
TSSA may have some evidence of a BPV at a location on file, there may be no inspection records 
pertaining to BPVs located at the address provided. 
▪ As of July 1, 2018, BPVs in Ontario may not be operated unless the Director has issued a current 
certificate of inspection (COI) to the owner or operator.  A COI will be issued to the owner or operator 
of the BPV by TSSA after TSSA has received a Record of Inspection (ROI) from the insurer/third-party 
inspector, the associated fees have been paid and the BPV has passed a periodic inspection. 
▪ Please note that if the BPV in question is insured, the insurance company may have additional 
inspection records.  Please contact the insurer directly should you wish to obtain further information.

The ERIS Physical Setting Report - PSR provides comprehensive information about the physical setting around a site and includes a 
complete overview of topography as well as hydrologic, geologic and soil characteristics.  The location and detailed attributes of oil and 
gas wells, water wells, and radon are also included for review. 
 
The compilation of both physical characteristics of a site and additional attribute data is useful in assessing the impact of migration of 
contaminants and subsequent impact on soils and groundwater.

This source is the results from the Cross-Canada Survey of Radon Concentrations in Homes, a two-year 
study conducted by Health Canada's National Radon Program. The aims of this study were to obtain an 
estimate of the proportion of the Canadian population living in homes with radon gas levels above the 
guideline of 200 Bq/m3, to identify previously unknown areas where radon gas exposure may constitute a 
health risk, and to build, over time, a map of indoor radon gas exposure levels across Canada.
